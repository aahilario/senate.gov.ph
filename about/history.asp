							Although 
							the Philippine Legislature was organized only in 1916, it had deep 
							roots in the past.&nbsp; 
							Long before the Spanish rulers came to the Philippines, the 
							people in their barangays were already governed by a set of rules by 
							their chief.&nbsp;
				        	Over the long span of Spanish and American rule, various&nbsp;
				        	forms of legislative structures&nbsp;
				        	were set up to perpetuate the colonial rulers’ desire to rule 
							the country.</span></p>
									<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">
									The Filipinos, just like other colonized people, fought for 
									independence from colonial rule. During this struggle, they 
									also recognized the critical role that a legislature could 
									play in the movement for independence. After the victory 
									over Spain, they established the Malolos Congress, based on 
									their Constitution. The Philippine Legislature, composed of 
									the Philippine Senate and the House of Representatives, was 
									created under the Philippine Autonomy Act, popularly known 
									as the Jones Law, which was passed by the Congress of the 
									United States and became law on August 29, 1916. It served 
									as the legislative body of the Philippines from October 1916 
									to November 1935, until it was succeeded by the National 
									Assembly upon the inauguration on November 15, 1935 of the 
									Commonwealth provided in the Constitution of the 
									Philippines.</p>
							<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">
							With independence from America in 
							1946, the legislature was called the Philippine Congress which 
							shared governmental powers with the executive and the judiciary. <br />
									<br />
							</p><p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">In 1972, the President 
							declared martial law and Congress was abolished. The bloodless coup 
							of February 22-25, 1986, brought forth a new regime and restored the 
							bicameral congress which is the present set-up of the Philippine 
							Legislature.</p>

									<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">
									Under the Spanish rule, the legislative powers were shared 
									by three entities: (1) the Governor-General who could 
									promulgate executive decrees, edicts or ordinances with the 
									force of the law; (2) the Royal Audencia, which passed laws 
									in the form of autos accordados; and (3) the Crown of Spain 
									acting through its councils.</p>
									<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">
									Serving as chief legislator was a governor-general who was 
									assisted by two advisory bodies where he stood as president. 
									The other entity exercising legislative powers in the 
									Philippines was the Royal Audencia which was the Spanish 
									Supreme Court in the Philippines. The governor-general also 
									stood as the president of this body.</p>
									<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">
									Many historians observed, however, that the legislative 
									function during the Spanish period was monopolized by a set 
									of interlocking bodies, where the Chief Legislator, the 
									governor-general, exercising unbounded powers, also stood as 
									president and member of other bodies which were supposed to 
									advise him. Filipino representation was also largely absent 
									in the legislative bodies.</p>						<p class="backtotop"><img src="../images/backtotop.gif" />

									In the closing years of the Spanish regime, the

									Malolos, Bulacan. This Congress was later on referred to as

									Several reasons prompted the creation and convening of the 
									Malolos Congress. Primarily, it was established to attract 
									the country’s elite—the intellectuals and the wealthy—to 
									join the revolution. Secondly, the creation of a 
									representative government was given primarily to make good 
									impression on foreign powers. A popular Assembly was deemed 
									necessary in order to enhance the image of the new Republic.</p>
									<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">
									The delegates to the Congress constituted the cream of the 
									country’s professionals and intellectuals. An official 
									directory of the Malolos Assembly of Representatives listed 
									a total of 201 members who had served the body at one time 
									or another. Most historians, however, have placed the 
									Assembly membership at only 130.</p>
									<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">
									The Assembly, despite time constraints, turned out to be a 
									prolific legislature. Its first official act was the 
									ratification of the “Act of Declaration of Independence” on 
									September 29, 1898. It also passed a number of important 
									laws designed to protect the new Republic from incursions of 
									foreigners and to protect the local business and labor. </p>
									<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">
									With the outbreak of the Philippine-American War in 
									February, 1899, the Assembly’s activities were hampered by 
									the emergency situation.</p>						<p class="backtotop"><img src="../images/backtotop.gif" />

						When the U.S. assumed sovereignty over the Philip-pines after the 
						Spanish-American War, a military government was set up, with the 
						military governor exercising executive, legislative and judicial powers.&nbsp;
				        In 1901, however, the legislative powers hitherto exercised by 
						the military governor were transferred to the Philippine Commission.&nbsp;
				        The legislative&nbsp; body&nbsp;
				        was&nbsp; the Philippine&nbsp;
				        Commission&nbsp; created 
						by the President&nbsp; of&nbsp;
				        the United States in his capacity as commander-in-chief of the 
						Armed Forces, which act was later ratified by the U.S. Congress in the 
						Philippine Bill&nbsp; of 1902.&nbsp;
				        This body served as the sole legislative body&nbsp;
				        of the Philippines until 1907 when the First Philippine Assembly 
						was convened&nbsp; and&nbsp;
				        created pursuant to the Philippine Bill&nbsp;of&nbsp;
				        1902. The members of&nbsp; 
						the Philippine Commission were appointed by the U.S. President with the 
						consent of the U.S. Senate, while those of the Philippine Assembly were elected by qualified electors in their respective 
						representative districts into which the country was&nbsp;
				        divided.</p>
									<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">
									The presiding officer of the Philippine Commission was also 
									the head of government himself—the American 
									governor-general. Its membership, starting in 1901, 
									consisted of five Americans and three Filipinos. Then in 
									1913, there were five locals to only four Americans. The 
									Commission commenced its legislative work on September 1, 
									1900, or barely three months after the civil government was 
									established in the Philippines. It started with only five 
									members, all Americans. The original members appointed by 
									the U.S. President were Judge William Taft, chairman; and 
									Dr. Dean Worcester, Mr. Luke Wright, Mr. Henry Ide, and 
									Prof. Bernard Moses, members. </p>
									<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">
									It was only in 1913 when the Filipinos finally obtained 
									numerical majority in what was now a nine-man legislative 
									body. This was made possible after Woodrow Wilson was 
									elected president of the United States. The new president, 
									through his new appointed Governor-General Francis Burton 
									Harrison, assured the Filipinos that his administration 
									would take steps to assure them of a majority in the 
									appointive Commission. Other well-known Filipinos who were 
									later tapped to serve the body were Gregorio Araneta, Juan 
									Sumulong and Rafael Palma. This was maintained up to 1916, 
									when it was replaced by the Philippine Senate, as provided 
									for by the Jones Law. </p>
									<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">
									As a legislative body, the Philippine Commission wielded 
									broad powers and discharged vital functions. These included 
									the power to make rules and orders having the effect of law, 
									for raising revenue by means of taxes, customs and import 
									duties. It also appropriated and spent public funds. It also 
									enacted pieces of legislation largely of general application 
									such as those establishing the country’s civil service 
									system and judicial network, organizing the Philippine 
									Constabulary and the police and creating the insular bureaus 
									and offices, municipal and provincial governments.</p>						<p class="backtotop"><img src="../images/backtotop.gif" />

									<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">
									The Philippine Assembly was convened at the old Manila Grand 
									Opera House on October 16, 1907. Two dominant political 
									groups—the Partido Nacionalista and Partido Nacional 
									Progresista vied for positions in the Assembly. Minority 
									parties also fielded their candidates as well as independent 
									aspirants. The NP, the party that espoused “immediate and 
									complete independence” headed by Sergio Osmeña, captured 
									majority of the 80 – seat Assembly. However, a situation of 
									conflict prevailed, for the legislative arm of government 
									consisted of an elective Assembly composed of Filipinos and 
									an appointive Commission (later to become the Senate), the 
									majority of the members of which were Americans. Such 
									conflicts, however, came to an end when the legislative 
									powers were vested by the Jones Law in a bicameral 
									legislature composed exclusively of Filipinos.&nbsp;From 1907 to 
									1916, the legislative power was vested in a legislature, 
									with the Philippine Commission as the upper house and the 
									Philippine Assembly as the lower house thereof.&nbsp;</p>
									<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">
									Pursuant to the provisions of the Jones Law, the legislative 
									set-up was changed. The Philippine Commission was abolished 
									and the Philippine Legislature, inaugurated on October 16, 
									1916, consisting of the Senate and the House of 
									Representatives was established. Thus, the history of 
									Philippine Senate can be traced in relative term from the 
									time the Americans colonized our country. </p>						<p class="backtotop"><img src="../images/backtotop.gif" />

				        			During its 19-year existence 
									the country went through seven elections —from 1916 to 
									1934—to elect members of both chambers of the Legislature. 
									In the first election, on the first Tuesday of October 1916, 
									two senators were elected from each of the 12 senatorial 
									districts—one for a term of six years; the other for three 
									years. In the subsequent general elections, there was to be 
									elected from each district one senator for six years. There 
									were two appointive members for the Senate who were 
									designated by the American governor-general to represent the 
									non-Christian areas of the Archipelago. The elective 
									Representatives served for three years, while the Senators, 
									except half of the 22 who won in the first senatorial race 
									in 1916, had a six-year tenure.&nbsp;</p>
									<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">
				        			The 24-man Philippine Senate 
									was represented by two Senators from each of the 12 
									senatorial districts into which the country was divided. 
									Eleven of the districts were represented by Senators elected 
									by qualified voters in their respective bailiwicks. The 
									twelfth senatorial district, which was then generally 
									inhabited by non-Christian Filipinos, was represented by two 
									appointive Senators who had no fixed terms. The two 
									appointive Senators were Joaquin A. Clarin and Jadji Butu 
									representing the provinces in Mindanao, Mountain province 
									and Baguio from 1916 to 1918, with the latter only being

									Senators who served in the Philippine Senate at one time or 
									another from 1916 to 1935. Over half of these senior solons 
									were reelected at least once. A number of them were elected 
									several times, as in the case of Manuel L. Quezon who 
									repeatedly served as Senator from 1916 to 1935, when he 
									assumed the Presidency of the Philippine Commonwealth.

									<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">

									The birth of the 
						Commonwealth of the Philippines ushered another change in the 
						legislative system when a uni-cameral National Assembly was convened as 
						provided in the 1935 Constitution. But the return to unicameralism was 
						short-lived. &nbsp;By virtue of a 
						constitutional amendment in 1940, a two-chamber Congress was restored.</p>
									<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">
									In accordance with the constitutional amendment of 1940, the 
									Legislature returned to its pre-Commonwealth structure with 
									the restoration of the Senate. Thus in the November, 1941 
									polls, more aspirants figured in what could be considered as 
									the first synchronized balloting of the country.</p>
									<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">
									Elected together with re-electionist President Quezon and 
									Vice-President Sergio Osmeña, the Nacionalista Senate bets 
									swamped the opposition. The NP candidates garnered not only 
									the 24 senatorial seats at stake but also 70 of the 89 Lower 
									House slots.</p>
									<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">
									Of the 24 senators-elect, the first eight placers were to 
									serve for 6 years, the next eight for 4 years and the last 
									eight for 2 years. After the war, though, a number of those 
									who were to serve for fewer years went on to assume their 
									posts when Congress convened in June 1945. A number of top 
									placers were not able to report for duty partly because some 
									of them were charged or had died. </p>
									<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">
									When the two chambers finally got organized in June 1945, 
									the election of officers was given top priority. Senator 
									Manuel A. Roxas, who had ranked second in the 1941 
									senatorial elections, was elected Senate President, while 
									Senator Elpidio Quirino was chosen President Pro Tempore. 
									</p>
									<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">
									On January 4, 1946, the Congress met again in a special 
									session to discuss the first postwar general elections. 
									Three months later—on April 23, 1946—that law-making body 
									gave way to the First Congress of the Third Republic.</p>						<p class="backtotop"><img src="../images/backtotop.gif" />

									<span style="color: windowtext">The 
									post-Independence Congress became the first legislature of 
									the Republic of the Philippines. That Congress’ first 
									members were elected during the dying days of the 
									Commonwealth in 1946, and the last barely a year before it 
									gave way to&nbsp;&nbsp; 
									martial law that ushered in the dictatorship in 1973.&nbsp;
				        All told, that legislature consisted of seven Congresses of four 
									years each except the final one, which lasted for only two 
									years.</span></p>
									<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">
									Like its immediate predecessor that emerged following the 
									first amendments of the 1935 Constitution, the Congress of 
									the Philippines had a Senate and a House of Representatives. 
									The members of the Senate were elected at large or 
									nationwide, unlike their predecessors who were elected by 
									regions for a term of 6 years. The Senate was composed of 24 
									members elected by qualified voters of the country. Certain 
									qualifications were required for an individual to become a 
									senator: he had to be a natural-born citizen, 35 years of 
									age upon election to the Senate, a qualified voter and a 
									resident of the Philippines for at least 2 years prior to 
									his election.</p>
									<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">
									The election of the First Congress—16 for the Senate and 104 
									for the House—took place on April 23, 1946. The Liberal 
									Party captured nine of the 16 senatorial seats. The rest 
									went to the Nacionalista candidates and their allies. 
									Senator Jose Avelino of Samar was elected as Senate 
									President at that time.</p>
									<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">
									In the 1947 polls, six LP bets—Lorenzo Tañada, Vicente 
									Madrigal, Geronima Pecson, Emiliano Tirona, Fernando Lopez 
									and Pablo David—were elected. Only two NPs were elected, 
									namely, Camilo Osias and Eulogio Rodriguez.</p>
									<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">
									However, a bitter rivalry ensued between newly installed 
									President Elpidio Quirino and LP Senate President Avelino 
									over party presidential nomination for the 1949 national 
									elections. Although the Senate was dominated by the “Avelino 
									Wing,” with 11 members including himself, the “Quirino LPs” 
									joined forces with the NPs to oust Avelino as Senate 
									President in early 1949. Senator Mariano Jesus Cuenco 
									replaced Avelino.</p>
									<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">
									Altogether, from 1949 to 1971, the last polls before the 
									exit of that Congress, the political leadership shifted from 
									one major political party to the other in both chambers.</p>
									<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">
									The Congress of the Philippines followed a certain schedule 
									for the session of both houses. They commenced their regular 
									sessions every fourth Monday of January, although this could 
									be changed as Congress saw fit. Every Congress had four 
									regular sessions lasting for 100 days, excluding Sundays. 
									Special sessions could also be called by the President to 
									tackle major bills left unfinished during regular sessions.</p>
									<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">
									Among the powers exercised by the Senate were:</p>
									<blockquote>
										<p align="justify">1. 
										Ratification of treaties entered into by the Executive; 
										and<br />
										2. Confirmation of appointments made by the President.
										</p>
									</blockquote>
									<p align="Justify" style="text-indent: 25px">
									The shifting of leadership in the Senate was quite active 
									during this period. The power struggle started during the 
									First Congress where Senate President Avelino, together with 
									Melecio Arranz as President Pro Tempore, was ousted from the 
									Senate helm four years later. In the Second Congress 
									(1950-1953), Avelino tried to bounce back but Senator 
									Mariano Cuenco replaced him for good following the former’s 
									expulsion from the top.</p>
									<p align="Justify" style="text-indent: 25px">
									When the Nacionalistas returned to power with Ramon 
									Magsaysay’s overwhelming victory in the 1953 presidential 
									elections, Eulogio Rodriguez of Rizal assumed the Senate 
									presidency for the first time and remained as its President 
									for nearly a decade. In the Fifth Congress, LP President 
									Ferdinand E. Marcos, who had been elected Senator a few 
									years earlier, toppled Rodrigue from the Senate presidency. 
									Senator Arturo Tolentino of Manila took over from Marcos in 
									1966. In the 7th Congress, fellow NP Senator Gil J. Puyat of 
									Pampanga and Manila assumed the Senate helm until it was 
									abolished in early 1973.</p>						<p class="backtotop"><img src="../images/backtotop.gif" />

									<o:p>When the popular “people power” or EDSA revolution

									<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">

									Constitution.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 1987 Constitution restored the 
									presidential system of government together with the 
									bicameral congress of the Philippines. Section 1, Article VI 
									of the 1987 Constitution provides as follows:</o:p></p>
									<blockquote>
										<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px"><i>

									committees and five (5) Oversight committees to fuel the 
									wheels of the legislative mill. The Senate or any of its 
									committees may conduct formal inquiries or investigations in 
									aid of legislation. The committees are classified into: (1) 
									standing or permanent; (2) special or ad hoc; (3) joint; and 
									(4) sub. Subcommittees are created to parcel the work of 
									standing or special committees. The &quot;special&quot; committees are 
									created for a particular purpose and dissolved after 
									accomplishing such purpose. Joint committees are those that
