							Procedures</p>
							<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 25px">
							<strong style="font-weight: 400">The procedures for introducing 
							legislation and seeing it through committees are similar in both the 
							House of Representatives and the Senate.&nbsp;</strong></p>
							<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 25px">
							<strong style="font-weight: 400">Legislative proposals originate in 
							a number of different ways. Members of the Senate, of course, 
							develop ideas for legislation. Technical assistance in research and 
							drafting legislative language is available at the Senate Legislative 
							Technical Affairs Bureau. Special interest groups—business, 
							religious, labor, urban and rural poor, consumers, trade 
							association, and the like—are other fertile sources of legislation. 
							Constituents, either as individuals or groups, also may propose 
							legislation. Frequently, a member of the Senate will introduce such 
							a bill by request, whether or not he supports its purposes.</strong></p>
							<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 25px">
							<strong style="font-weight: 400">It must be noted also that much of 
							the needed legislation of the country today considered by Congress 
							originates from the executive branch. Each year after the President 
							of the Philippines outlines his legislative program in his 
							State-of-the-Nation Address, executive departments and agencies 
							transmit to the House and the Senate drafts of proposed legislations 
							to carry out the President’s program.</strong></p>

												<a name="Introduction_of_Bills"></a>Introduction 
							of Bills</p>
							<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 25px">
							<strong style="font-weight: 400">No matter where a legislative 
							proposal originates, it can be introduced only by a member of 
							Congress. In the Senate, a member may introduce any of several types 
							of bills and resolutions by filing it with the Office of the 
							Secretary. </strong></p>
							<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 25px">
							<strong style="font-weight: 400">There is no limit to the number of 
							bills a member may introduce. House and Senate bills may have joint 
							sponsorship and carry several members&#39; names. </strong></p>
							<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 25px">
							<strong style="font-weight: 400">Major legislation is often 
							introduced in both houses in the form of companion (identical) 
							bills, the purpose of which is to speed up the legislative process 
							by encouraging both chambers to consider the measure simultaneously. 
							Sponsors of companion bills may also hope to dramatize the 
							importance or urgency of the issue and show broad support for the 
							legislation. </strong></p>

							Legislation</p>
							<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 25px">
							<strong style="font-weight: 400">The type of measures that Congress 
							may consider and act upon (in addition to treaties in the Senate) 
							include bills and three kinds of resolutions. They are:</strong></p>
							<blockquote>
								<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><strong>1. Bills</strong></p>
								<blockquote>
									<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 25px">
									<strong style="font-weight: 400">These are general measures, 
									which if passed upon, may become laws. A bill is prefixed 
									with S., followed by a number assigned the measure based on 
									the order in which it is introduced. The vast majority of 
									legislative proposals––recommendations dealing with the 
									economy, increasing penalties for certain crimes, regulation 
									on commerce and trade, etc., are drafted in the form of 
									bills. They also include budgetary appropriation of the 
									government and many others. When passed by both chambers in 
									identical form and signed by the President or repassed by 
									Congress over a presidential veto, they become laws.
									</strong></p>
								</blockquote>
								<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><strong>2. Joint 
								Resolutions</strong></p>
								<blockquote>
									<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 25px">
									<strong style="font-weight: 400">A joint resolution, like a 
									bill, requires the approval of both houses and the signature 
									of the President. It has the force and effect of a law if 
									approved. There is no real difference between a bill and a 
									joint resolution. The latter generally is used when dealing 
									with a single item or issue, such as a continuing or 
									emergency appropriations bill. Joint resolutions are also 
									used for proposing amendments to the Constitution. </strong>
									</p>
								</blockquote>
								<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><strong>3. Concurrent 
								Resolutions</strong></p>
								<blockquote>
									<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 25px">
									<strong style="font-weight: 400">A concurrent resolution is 
									usually designated in the Senate as S. Ct. Res. It is used 
									for matters affecting the operations of both houses and must 
									be passed in the same form by both of them. However, they 
									are not referred to the President for his signature, and 
									they do not have the force of law. Concurrent resolutions 
									are used to fix the time of adjournment of a Congress and to 
									express the “sense of Congress” on an issue. </strong></p>
								</blockquote>
								<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><strong>4. Simple 
								Resolutions</strong></p>
								<blockquote>
									<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 25px">
									<strong style="font-weight: 400">It is usually designated 
									with P. S. Res. A simple resolution deals with matters 
									entirely within the prerogative of one house of Congress, 
									such as adopting or receiving its own rules. A simple 
									resolution is not considered by the other chamber and is not 
									sent to the President for his signature. Like a concurrent 
									resolution, it has no effect and force of a law. Simple 
									resolutions are used occasionally to express the opinion of 
									a single house on a current issue. Oftentimes, it is also 
									used to call for a congressional action on an issue 
									affecting national interest. </strong></p>

							<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 25px">
							<strong style="font-weight: 400">Once a measure has been introduced 
							and given a number, it is read and referred to an appropriate 
							committee. It must be noted that during the reading of the bill, 
							only the title and the author is read on the floor. The Senate 
							President is responsible for referring bills introduced to 
							appropriate committees.&nbsp; </strong></p>
							<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 25px">
							<strong style="font-weight: 400">The jurisdictions of the Standing 
							Committees are spelled out in Rule X, Section 13 of the Rules of the 
							Senate. For example, if a bill involves matters relating to 
							agriculture, food production and agri-business, it must be referred 
							to the Committee on Agriculture and Food. </strong></p>						<p class="backtotop"><img src="/images/backtotop.gif" />

							<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 25px">
							<strong style="font-weight: 400">The standing committees of the 
							Senate, operating as “little legislatures,” determine the fate of 
							most proposals. There are committee hearings scheduled to discuss 
							the bills referred. Committee members and staff frequently are 
							experts in the subjects under their jurisdiction, and it is at the 
							committee stage that a bill comes under the sharpest scrutiny. If a 
							measure is to be substantially revised, the revision usually occurs 
							at the committee level. </strong></p>
							<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 25px">
							<strong style="font-weight: 400">A committee may dispose of a bill 
							in one of several ways: it may approve, or reject, the legislation 
							with or without amendments; rewrite the bill entirely; reject it, 
							which essentially kills the bill; report it favorably or without 
							recommendation, which allows the chamber to consider the bill at 
							all. It must be noted that under Section 29, Rule XI of the Rules of 
							the Senate, if the reports submitted are unfavorable, they shall be 
							transmitted to the archives of the Senate, unless five Senators 
							shall, in the following session, move for their inclusion in the 
							Calendar for Ordinary Business, in which case the President shall so 
							order. </strong></p>						<p class="backtotop"><img src="/images/backtotop.gif" />

									Order of Business and read to the Senate in accordance with 
									the second paragraph of Section 24 hereof, shall not be 
									allowed to speak against the bill during the period of 
									general debate although he may propose and speak or vote on 
									amendments thereto.</strong></p>
									<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify">
									<strong style="font-weight: 400; font-style: italic">(d) The 
									sponsor of the bill or author of the motion shall have the 
									right to close the debate. </strong></p>
									<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify">
									<strong style="font-weight: 400; font-style: italic">(e)

									distributed to the Members at least three (3) days prior to 
									their passage, except when the President of the Philippines 
									certifies to the necessity of their immediate enactment to 
									meet a public calamity or emergency, in which case the

							</blockquote>
							<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 25px">
							<strong style="font-weight: 400">After the bill is approved on Third

								<strong style="font-weight: 400">A bill is filed in the Office 
								of the Secretary where it is given a corresponding number and

								<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 25px">
								<strong style="font-weight: 400">Its title, bill number, and 
								author’s name are read on the floor, after which it is referred 
								to the proper committee. </strong></p>
								<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><strong>Committee 
								Hearings/Report</strong></p>
								<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 25px">
								<strong style="font-weight: 400">Committee conducts hearings and 
								consultation meetings. It then either approves the proposed bill 
								without an amendment, approves it with changes, or recommends 
								substitution or consolidation with similar bills filed. </strong>

								Second Reading</strong></p>
								<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 25px">

								<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 25px">
								<strong style="font-weight: 400">Bill author delivers 
								sponsorship speech on the floor. Senators engage in debate, 
								interpellation, turno en contra, and rebuttal to highlight the 
								pros and cons of the bill. A period of amendments incorporates 
								necessary changes in the bill proposed by the committee or 
								introduced by the Senators themselves on the floor. </strong>

								<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><strong>Voting on 
								Second Reading</strong></p>
								<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 25px">
								<strong style="font-weight: 400">Senators vote on the second 
								reading version of the bill. If approved, the bill is calendared

								Reading</strong></p>
								<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 25px">
								<strong style="font-weight: 400">Printed copies of the bill’s 
								final version are distributed to the Senators. This time, only

								held. If passed, the approved Senate bill is referred to the 
								House of Representatives for concurrence. </strong></p>
								<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><strong>At the House of

								<strong style="font-weight: 400">If the House-approved version 
								is compatible with that of the Senate’s, the final version’s 
								enrolled form is printed. If there are certain differences, a 
								Bicameral Conference Committee is called to reconcile 
								conflicting provisions of both versions of the Senate and of the 
								House of Representatives. Conference committee submits report on 
								the reconciled version of the bill, duly approved by both 
								chambers. The Senate prints the reconciled version in its 
								enrolled form. </strong></p>

								Malacañang</strong></p>
								<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: Justify; text-indent: 25px">
