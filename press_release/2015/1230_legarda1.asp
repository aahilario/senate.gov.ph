<span class="PRTitle"><!-- NewsTitle.start -->Legarda Hopes for a Better, More Resilient Year Ahead<!-- NewsTitle.end --></span>
</p>
<!-- NewsBody.start -->
<p style="text-align: justify">Senator Loren Legarda today said she looks forward to a better year ahead for the country, particularly in terms of pursuing sustainable, inclusive and resilient development.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Legarda, who chairs the Senate committees on finance, climate change, and cultural communities, said she is hopeful that government programs for 2016 will not only provide for the basic needs of citizens but also proactively address the risks that threaten meaningful progress.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">"I am optimistic it will be a different year because we have introduced important provisions in the 2016 General Appropriations Act (GAA) that would align government programs with the Sustainable Development Goals or SDGs, the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, and our Intended Nationally-Determined Contribution (INDC) for climate change mitigation and adaptation," she said.   "We have also provided very specific line items that are responsive to the needs of fisherfolks and coastal communities, farmers, rural folks, indigenous communities. We introduced amendments that will support 4th, 5th and 6th class municipalities and barangays in the country," she added.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Legarda has introduced general and special provisions mostly in the areas of environmental protection, community resilience and heritage preservation, which she said are often neglected but are very much valuable to the development of the nation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">In relation to climate change adaptation (CCA) and disaster risk reduction (DRR):</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">(1) Dam operators must ensure that dams are properly maintained, managed and operated with updated and promulgated protocols that take into account climate change and extreme weather events and ensure coordination with the PAGASA on precipitation forecast;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">(2) In retrofitting bridges and other public infrastructure, the government must give priority to areas considered to be highly vulnerable to seismic activity;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">(3) The Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) must provide support to all agrarian reform communities (ARCs) for them to be attuned to CCA and DRR;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">(4) The Department of Agriculture (DA) should increase the resilience of agricultural communities and conduct seminars and trainings for local government units (LGUs);</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">(5) The Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) and the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) must build at least four permanent evacuation centers in every region and ensure that evacuation centers are built on safe sites and designed to withstand wind speed of three hundred (300) kilometers per hour and moderate seismic activity of at least 8.0 magnitude on the Richter scale; utilize green design and include a rainwater catchment system, facilities for the special needs of women, children, the elderly, and persons with disabilities (PWDs) and such other physical provisions guaranteeing a humane condition for evacuees;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">(6) The Department of Science and Technology (DOST) must give priority to research on DRR and CCA to ensure that policy development and planning at all levels are based on science and contributing to building resilience;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">(13) All national government agencies, LGUs and government owned and controlled corporations  (GOCCs) shall embark on energy efficiency measures and adopt the use of energy efficient lighting.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">(14) The Department of Education (DepEd) shall require public schools to establish rainwater collection systems (RWCS) that conform to the prototypes prescribed by the DPWH, vegetable gardens, and materials recovery facilities (MRF);</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">(15) State universities and colleges (SUCs), in coordination with the LGUs, shall include in their research program the mapping and inventory of the biodiversity of the province where the main campus of the SUC is located.
