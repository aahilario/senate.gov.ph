</p>
<!-- NewsBody.start --><p style="text-align: justify"><em>Note:  This is based on Senate record as delivered by Sen. Vicente C. Sotto III on August 13, 2012 during his Turno en Contra speech against Reproductive Health Bill   
</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Mr.  President. Maraming  salamat  po, malaking utang na loob ko po sa inyo.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">To  set  the  tone,  Mr.  President,  of  my  turno  en  contra  speech,  I  am presenting a less-than-a-minute short video to show the greatest gift that God has given man.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">PART I (Show video)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Mr.  President,  my  esteemed  colleagues,  I  stand  up  for  life.    This Chamber,  the  Senate,  is  an  institution  that  traces  its  lineage  to  the  political structure of ancient Rome where matters of policy were debated and decided in a council of elders--Senatus Populus Que Romanus/ the Senate and the People of Rome.  At that time, as now, issues were hotly argued, and sometimes lives and honors put at risk, and scrutiny.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Our times, our Chamber and our persons will be defined and judged, not only  by  the  bills  that  become  laws,  but  also  by  the  bills  that  are  lost  and rejected. Past circumstances  defined  the  Senate  of  their  time.    During  the Commonwealth  period,  this  Chamber  was  defined  by  the  issue  of  Philippine Independence  when  my  grandfather  and  namesake  sat  as  Senator,  often clashing with then President Manuel Luis Quezon; during the early years of the Republic  after  the  Second  World  War,  this  Chamber  was  defined  when  it favored Parity Rights  for Americans,  then popular, but which historians  later considered  a  sell-out;  during  the  1970's,  this  Chamber  imploded  with  the declaration  of  Martial  Law;  and  after  the  EDSA  Revolution  of  1986  and 14 thereafter,  this  Chamber  was  resurrected  and  was  distinguished  by  a  new-found nationalism with its rejection of American military bases in 1991 which included the present Senate President.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Today, we  will  define  ourselves  again,  Mr.  President, as  we  decide whether we shall adopt a measure  that  is dictated by outside cultures,  forces and philosophies, or we shall be true to our Filipino reverence  for human  life, the solidarity of  the  family, and  the  right of parents  to determine  their  family size without interference from the State.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">We have heard these past months the sponsors of Senate Bill No. 2865, entitled  "An Act  Providing  for  a   National  Policy  on Reproductive Health  and Population Development  popularly  known  as  the  Reproductive Health  or  the RH Bill.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Ang sabi po nila ay ang mga sumusunod:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">1.  The  RH  Bill  will  save  the  lives  of  the  mother  and  the  unborn.  Payag po ako riyan.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">2.  The RH Bill will provide Filipinos with information on reproductive health which they can use to make informed and intelligent decisions.   Payag din po ako riyan.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">3.  The  RH  Bill  will  provide  Filipinos  with  access  to  health  care facilities and skilled health professionals.   Ang alam ko mayroon na iyan.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">4.   The RH Bill does not promote or legalize abortion.  I find this quite inaccurate, Mr. President.  Why? I will point out later.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">5.  The RH Bill does not impose one mode of family planning method on  every Filipino woman and  that  every person will be allowed  to  choose  the method suitable to her needs and her religious belief.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">6.  The RH bill does not limit the size of the Filipino family.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">7.  The RH Bill does  not  promote  sexual  promiscuity  among  the Filipino youth.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Now, Mr. President, as I mentioned earlier under the Rules of the Senate, I am allowed to go on a general debate and I speak against the said bill which we commonly call  it  the  turno en contra. In other words,  kami naman po ang pakinggan ninyo.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">I  will  now  present my  opposition  to  the  RH  Bill  in  four  parts  starting today,  August  13,  2012. I hope  to  finish  the  first  portion  today  and  the remaining  chapters  in  the  coming  days.  I seek the kind  indulgence  of  this Chamber  to bear with me. I will try my best  to  abbreviate  it  and,  as  I have mentioned earlier,   we will  try  to compact  it more so  that  it will not  take  too much time of the Senate.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Now,  Mr.  President, I strongly believe that Senate Bill No.  2865 is not necessary, not beneficial, and not practical for our people.  It will not serve the common good and, therefore, should be rejected.   Deceptive  information,  as well  as unreliable  and  distorted  statistics, have  been  peddled  by  people with motives who  I will unmask  in  the succeeding chapters. They have found their way into the arguments of the RH bill.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Now, my main objections to the Reproductive Health Bill are as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">1.  The  RH  Bill  violates  Philippine  sovereignty,  the  Philippine Constitution and existing penal laws;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">2.  The RH Bill is detrimental to the health of a pregnant mother and puts the life of the unborn on the line;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">3.  The RH Bill violates our financial independence and the autonomy of local governments; and</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">4.  The RH Bill transgresses Filipino culture and family values.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Here is my main discussion, Mr. President.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">DISCUSSION</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Article II, Section 12 of the Philippine Constitution provides:  The State shall equally protect the life of the mother and the life of the unborn from conception.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">In  the  Records  of  the  Constitutional  Commission  that  drafted  the  1987 Constitution,  Commissioner  Bernardo  Villegas,  in  his  sponsorship  speech dated September 12, 1986 on the article mandating the State to equally protect the life of the mother and the life of the unborn from the moment of conception, stated:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">"The  first  question  that  needs  to  be  answered:  Is  the  fertilized  ovum alive? Biology categorically says yes, the fertilized ovum is alive."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Malinaw po na napag-usapan  sa pagpandayng ating Konstitusyon kung kailan nagiging tao ang tao.  Itong katotohanan na ito ngayon ang binubuwag at nais palitan ng mga nagtutulak  ng RH bill.  Sa katunayan, ang  isa po sa mga nagsusulong ng RH bill,  itong  International Planned Parenthood Federation or  IPPF  ang  nag-atas  sa  mga  medical  associations  na  i-ayon  at  palitan  ang depinisyon ng pagbubuntis magmula sa tinatawag na conception at gawin itong implantasyo n.  In the book  entitled Deadly Deception by James Sedlak,  it  says  that  to avoid arguments on  the  issue on whether contraceptives are abortifacients or not  in  the  late 1960's,  IPPF and  its affiliates got some medical associations  to define a pregnancy as beginning at implantation and not conception.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Now,  let me go back to the deliberations on Article II, Section 12 of our Constitution.   The second question that was raised was:  Is the alive fertilized ovum human?  Again, the  answer  is  categorical  yes.    Genetics, give  us  an equally strong yes.   At the moment of conception, the nuclei of the ovum and the sperm rupture.  As this happens,  23  chromosomes  from  the  ovum combined  with  23  chromosomes  of  the  sperm  to  form  a  total  of  46 chromosomes.    A  chromosome  count  of  46  is  found  only--I  repeat,  Mr.  President, only--in a human being.  Therefore, the fertilized ovum is a human being. Biology  and  neonatal  experts  have  also  spoken  at  the  beginning  of human  life, and  let me quote a  few of  them and place  into  the Records of  the Senate.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">"Individual human life begins at conception and  is progressive, ongoing continuum  until  natural  death.    This  is  a  fact  so  well  established  that  no intellectually honest physician  in  full command of modern medical knowledge would dare to deny it.  There is no authority in medicine or biology who can be cited to refute this concept.  (Source:  D.J. Moran, M.D.; J.D. Gorby, M.D.; T.W. Hilgers, M.D.   Title:   "Abortion  in  the Supreme Court: Death Becomes a Way of Life. "Abortion and Social Justice, Sheed and Ward, 1974.)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Medical  textbook  authors  have  also  confirmed  that  the  "formation, maturation,  and meeting  of  a male  and  female  sex  cell  are  all preliminary  to their  actual union into a combined cell, or zygote, which definitely marks the beginning of a new individual."  (Source:  Lesley Arey, Development Anatomy 7th Edition, 1974. Philadelphia W.B. Saunders Publishers.)   "Every time a sperm cell and ovum unite, a new being is created which is alive  and  will  continue  to  live  unless  its  death  is  brought  about  by  some specific  condition. (Source:  E.L.  Potter,  M.D.  and  J.M.  Craig, M.D.    Title:  Pathology of the Fetus and  the  Infant, 3rd Edition. Chicago Year Book Medical Publishers, 1975.)  Kasama pa nga po dito sa mga foreign authorities even ex-President Bill Clinton in a book, His Life, on page 302 admits to that fact, Mr.  President, kung ayaw ninyo ng  foreign authorities, punta  tayo sa  lokal.   Dr. Oscar Tinio,  President  of  the  Philippine Medical  Association  (PMA),  has  stated  that  "life begins at fertilization" and anything that prevents the fertilized ovum from being implanted in the uterus is already considered "abortive".</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">If you do not completely agree with me and these authorities, and decide to  believe    in  foreign  studies  sponsored  and  funded  by  Alan  Guttmacher Research  Institute studies,  I would advise  that why do not we  try asking our conscience as the unborn child speaks to us in this video.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">[Video playing]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">I beg the Chair's indulgence, there is something wrong with the video.  It should  have  explained  what  was  happening  there.    But,  hopefully--well, probably,  we  can  skip  that  and  hopefully  we  can  give  the  Members  of  the Senate a copy of that.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Now,  if  we  think  that  conception  starts  at  implantation  as  what  the proponents  of  this  bill want  us  to  accept  as  true,  and  not  from  fertilization, then we have just deprived that baby that we saw of his right to be born.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Now that I feel that I have tried to establish when human life begins, let me now go to the question on how this contraceptives act as abortifacients.  Ito po.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Ginoong Pangulo, hindi po ako nagdudunung-dunungan dito.  Hindi ko  po  iniimbento  ito  ha.    Itong  mga  kinu-quote  ko  po  dito,  mga  facts  na pinapatotohanan  ng  mga  eksperto  sa  larangan  ng  agham  at  batas. Several  studies  and  authorities  have  shown  that  hormonal  contraceptives  act  as abortifacients.  I firmly believe  that  those  who  denied  the  abortifacient properties of the pill and the  IUD have unjustifiably transferred the beginning of life from fertilization to implantation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">My point is this, Mr. President.  Ovulation and fertilization can still occur despite pills intake.  They do not prevent ovulation 100% of the time.  There are even studies that show that they fail 8 to 10% rate, and thus, fertilization can still occur. There are women  with  abnormal  bleeding  and  test  positive  in pregnancy tests despite taking the pill.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Unfortunately, the  pill,  whether  oral,  patch  or  injectable,  renders  the uterus  hostile  to  implantation.  When the fertilized  ovum  is  prevented  from implanting in the uterus because of the effect of the pill, this ovum is expelled.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">This is plain  and  simple  abortion, Mr. President.   Morning-after pills,  on  the other hand, when taken in large doses within 72 hours after sexual intercourse no longer prevents fertilization but implantation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">In the case of the intrauterine device, the IUD,   it  does  not  prevent ovulation and so  fertilization may occur several  times  in  the span of  time  the device is in the womb of the woman.  However, most fetuses will not be able to implant themselves because there is an "appliance" in the womb that prevents them from  doing  so.    Is  it  not  that  in  science,  we  have  the  term  "matter occupies space"?  Kung may umuokupa na, papaano pa makakapasok ang fetus sa  bahay  niya?   Kung  tayo  ngang malalaki  at matatanda, marami  na  tayong naririnig  na  nag-aagawan  ng  bahay, may  nakatirang  informal  settler  o  kaya mga professional squatters na  tinatawag. Pero  tayo,  ipinaglalaban pa rin natin ang  karapatan  nating  tumira  doon.    Itong  mga  fetus  na  ito,  hindi  sila makakalaban  sa mga  foreign objects na umaagaw  sa  lugar nila,   at  ang mga pills na nagre-renovate ng bahay dapat nila, ginagawa itong non-livable.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Ito  ang  dahilan  kung  bakit  lubos  kong  tinututulan  ang  pagpasa  ng   RH Bill.    Hindi  ko  naman  yata  hahayaan,  G.  Pangulo,  na may maging  batas  na kikitil  lamang  sa  mga  buhay  na  walang  kalaban-laban.    Ano  ang  karapatan natin na isabatas ang pagdi-distribute ng abortifacient pills at IUDS na ito, Para lang  sa  sinasabing  reproductive  health?  Ito  ba  ang  nakikita  na  lang  nilang sagot o solusyon?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Kung  tutuusin  hindi  ito  nakakatulong  sa  reproductive  health  ng  mga kababaihan.    Sa  katunayan,  nakakasira  pa  nga  ito  sa  kanilang  kalusugan.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">There  are  numerous  side  effects  of  contraceptives, which,  unfortunately,  are not made known to  the general public.  Unahin natin ang side effects ng pills. There are numerous studies  showing  its  carcinogenic  properties  since  the development of the synthetic estrogens in 1938 by Sir Edward Charles Dodds.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) on  the World Health Organization announced on July 29, 2005  that after a  thorough review of  the published  scientific  literature,  it  has  concluded  that  combined  estrogen- progestogen  oral  contraceptives  and  combined  estrogen-progestogen menopausal  therapy  are  carcinogenic  to  humans.  (Group  1  category.  This category  is  used  when  there  is  sufficient  evidence  of  carcinogenicity  in humans.)    The  listed  major  adverse  effects  of  the  pill  on  women  are  the following: breast cancer, cervical cancer, liver cancer, premature hypertension, and  coronary  artery  disease  resulting  in  heart  attacks  and  strokes, thromboembolism pulmonary  embolism.   Other  adverse  effects  are decreased libido,  infertility,  leg  cramps,  gallstone  formation,  nausea,  bloatedness,  etcetera.  Next are the side effects of the  IUD, Mr. President.    Intrauterine devices have been said to have the following effects; cramps, bleeding without periods, pelvic inflammatory disease, infertility and tear or hole in the uterus.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Even condoms pose a serious health risk.  As pointed out by Sen. "Ping" Lacson, the size of the pores in condoms is 5 microns.  What is alarming is that the size of the HIV virus  is 0.1 micron.   There can still be transmission of the HIV virus  even with  the use  of  a  condom,  because  0.1 micron will  definitely pass  through  5  microns.    Even  the  US  government  has  withdrawn  US$2.6 million  worth  of  grants  to  study  condoms,  because  an  unacceptably  high number of condom users probably would have been  infected  in such a study.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">No one wanted to take part in the study for fear of getting infected by the HIV virus.  So, the US government withdrew the grant.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Given  these  all  harmful  effects  to  women,  are  we  going  to  allow  our government  to spend billions of money  to purchase condoms, pills, and  IUDs for  the  sake  of  what  they  call  reproductive  health?    Hindi  ito  ang  sagot  sa sinasabing  11 mothers  die  every  day,  kung  totoo  man  iyong  11 mothers  die every day na  iyan.   Sapagkat sa susunod na chapter po,  ita-take up ko po  ito.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Humihingi ako ng statistics sa kanila.   Hindi po ako nabigyan.    Itinuro ako sa NSO, humingi ako sa NSO, hindi rin ako nabigyan. Gumawa kami ng survey na sarili  namin. Nagpaikot  ako  sa mga  regional  hospital  kung  ilan  ang  namatay noong 2011.  I will present  it  in the next chapter, Mr. President, to prove that 11 mothers do not die every day in the Philippines.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Kung maipapasa natin  itong RH Bill, malamang higit pa sa 11 mothers a day ang puwedeng mamatay kapag ganito ang nangyayari sa mga kababaihan natin lalo na ang side effects nitong mga pills na ito.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Ngunit hindi ko po maintindihan kung bakit  sa pamamagitan ng RH bill tayo  pa  ang  magdadagdag  ng  dahilan  para  dumami  ang  sakit  nila. Kung magbibigay  tayo  ng  pondo  gamit  ang  buwis  na  ibinabayad  ng  ating  mga mamamayan sa mga contraceptives na ito, dapat maglaan na rin tayo ng pondo para sa mga sakit na puwedeng idulot ng mga ito.    Actually, these contraceptives are not just detrimental to women and the unborn. They are scientifically proven  to  have  damaging  effects  to  children born from mothers who were using contraceptives prior to their pregnancy, too.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">According  to  Dr.  Natasha  Campbell-McBride,  M.D.,  the  use  of  the  pill  also causes  severe  gut  dysbiosis.    What  is  worse,  drug  induced  gut  imbalance especially  intractable and  resistant  to  treatment either with probiotics or diet  change.  Gut  imbalance  brought  on  through  the  use  of  the  pill  negatively impacts  the ability  to digest  food and absorb nutrients. As a result, even  if a woman  eats  spectacularly well during pregnancy,  if  she has been  taking oral contraceptives  for a period of  time beforehand,  it  is highly  likely  that she and her baby are not reaping the full benefits of all these healthy food as the lack of beneficial flora in her gut preclude this from occurring.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Pathogenic opportunistic flora that take hold in the gut when  the pill  is used  constantly produce  toxic  substances which  are  the by-products  of  their metabolism. These toxins  leak  into  the woman's bloodstream  and  they have the potential to cross the placenta.   Therefore, gut dysbiosis exposes the fetus to toxins.   Not well known is also the fact that the use of the pill depletes zinc in the body.  Zinc is called the "intelligence mineral" as it is intimately involved in mental development.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Mr.  President, many  could  attest  to  the  negative  effects  of  these contraceptives to their children.  Senator Lito Lapid revealed during one of the interpellations on this measure that his wife became pregnant despite the use of contraceptives, and thus, was born their third child who turned out to be a "blue  baby".  He said  that while  they were  told  that  the  baby would  live  for many  years  if  it manages  to  reach  age  14,  the  baby  succumbed  to  a  heart attack at age nine.  He and his wife attributed the death to the contraceptives that his  wife  took.  Senator Lapid believes  that contraceptives  cause  the increasing number  of  child  abnormalities  and  genetic  disorders  such  as  cleft chin, multiple births, conjoined or Siamese twins disorder which were not that many before contraceptives were introduced.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">During that time, Mr. President, when Senator Lito Lapid was telling a story, I was tempted to stand to share my own personal experience.  But I did not, I restrained myself.  I waited for this moment.  You see, Mr. President, my wife, Helen, and  I, nawalan po kami ng anak dahil  sa  contraceptives.   Helen and I eloped in 1969, got married, but got publicly married in 1971.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Our first-born  or  our  eldest  daughter, Romina, was  born  in  1973.   Most  people  know that we have  four  children.     Actually, we have  six, Mr. President. My  eldest daughter,  of  course,  is  the  wife  of  Senator  Pangilinan  that  is  why  he  was surprised the other day when  I called him son-in-law, although not biological, but she is our eldest daughter even in 1969 when my wife and I got married.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">In 1973, my eldest daughter was born and Helen was still doing movies and television  activities.  So,  she  decided  to  heed  what  a  doctor-  friend suggested  that  she  take  contraceptives.  She  did.  After  Romina  was  born  in January of 1973, she started taking contraceptives.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Mr. President, after a few months, by 1974, Helen became pregnant even though she was taking contraceptives. She gave birth to my real first son who we named Vincent Paul  in March 13, 1975 at  the Makati Medical Center. He was born with a weak heart. He needed blood transfusion every now and then.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">His blood was type A+, the same as mine, my father and my elder brother. That is why we had  to  give him  blood  transfusion. Bina-blood  transfusion  po  siya everyday. He stayed in the hospital for five months since birth. Nakauwi na ho si  Helen,  nandoon  pa  rin  ang  baby  namin  na  kauna-unahan  kong  anak  na lalaki.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">I visited him everyday. I went to the nursery everyday, but before that  I always go to the chapel to pray, pray for him and go visit him, stay for an hour or so every now and then kasama ko po si Helen. After five months, he passed away.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Noong binanggit ni Senator Lapid na namatayan siya ng anak nine years after, nine years old namatay, si Senadora Pia namatayan din po ng anak, after nine months namatay ang anak niya, nalulungkot po akong marinig sa kanila iyon. But the truth is, parang naiinggit pa nga ako, Mr. President, dahil mabuti pa nga sila nahawakan nila ang anak nila.  Iyong anak ko  five months ni hindi ko nahipo. Nahawakan ko patay  na. Makati Medical Center  can prove  to  the fact na wala silang makitang dahilan kung bakit nagkaganoon iyong bata kundi dahil nag-contraceptives  iyong asawa ko. Nabuntis pa  rin kahit na gumagamit ng  contraceptives.  That is  why  I  know.  Kaya  binanggit  ko  kanina.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Mr. President, na hindi trabaho ito sa akin, personalan ito. Ipinanganak  iyong  anak  kong  lalaki  but he never  left  the hospital. Ang sabi ng Makati Medical Center, ang dahilan ng pagkamatay ng anak ko ay ang paggamit ng misis ko ng contraceptives. Even her doctor, Dra. Enverga Santos, admits to that fact.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">He was born and died with a weak heart. Noong taong iyon...By the way, Mr. President, just for the record, he died August 13, 1975, 37 years ago today. Noong  taong  iyon,  1975,  tinanong  ko  po  ang  Panginoong  Diyos  kung  bakit  nangyari sa akin iyon.  Gustung-gusto kong magkaroon ng anak na lalaki.  Bakit kinuha niya sa akin?  Tinanong ko Siya ngunit wala akong nakuhang sagot.  Mr. President.   Thirty seven years after,  ibinigay sa akin ng Panginoong Diyos ang sagot.   Kasi magiging misyon ko pala  ito.    Ito pala ang dahilan para  ipaglaban ko  ang  karapatang  mabuhay  ng  maraming  inosenteng  bata  na  kikitilin  ang buhay nitong bill na ito.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">My son died August 13, 1975, Mr. President.  Nagkataon lamang ho ito. I was scheduled to deliver my speech  last August 6 ngunit nagkabagyo, at nag-uulan  at  nausog  ng  August  8.    Hindi  rin  tayo  natuloy  at  na-schedule  ako  ngayong August 13.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Mr. President, my dear colleagues, may I continue my speech on another day.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Thank you, Mr. President.</p>
