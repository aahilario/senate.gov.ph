</p>
<!-- NewsBody.start -->
<p style="text-align: justify">BERNADETTE SEMBRANO: Let's talk to Sen. Grace Poe, chairperson of the Senate committee on public order and dangerous drugs. Good afternoon Sen. Poe.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">POE: Good afternoon Bernadette and Tony. Good afternoon to our televiewers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">TONY VELASQUEZ: What exactly was the reason given by General Pusima why he couldn't attend the hearing today?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">POE: That was exactly my question. When we started the hearing, I wanted it set on record from among the PNP representative what the reason was behind his absence and they really couldn't give me a straight answer regarding that, they didn't know. All they said was they have no official knowledge of his schedule for the day. We sent him a letter about 11 days ago and we've been corresponding and dealing with the PNP liaison to the Senate and apparently up until yesterday which is about 7pm yesterday they confirmed attendance of Chief Purisima so we were surprised why at the last minute he didn't attended. In fact yesterday one of my legislative representative told them that I was really expecting Chief Purisima to attend unless there was a pressing emergency and a valid reason why he couldn't.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">SEMBRANO: But did he send anyone on his behalf?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">POE: Well he sent a few of them actually on his behalf, but my point, Bernadette, is that we were tackling the PNP modernization bills, so we really need to hear from the chief exactly what they need. If there's anybody who need to defend what the PNP needs to be able to perform their task and duty well, it should be the Chief himself. Another reason why I say it's an opportune moment for him to be there, the President just reiterated he's trust and how he has fate in the PNP Chief to be able to resolve crime so that he can continue on his job. He should have been there to be able to prove a point that you know they've been saying that police presence is important but then the mere fact that he is usually absent when it comes to certain issues about the PNP, I don't think he's sending the right message to the people especially we need to hear from the PNP Chief what the plans of the PNP are with regard to resolving crime and also I think the police themselves would really have to feel his leadership.  I know this is a job that entails so many different responsibilities but one of them is you should be able to communicate well to the people what the PNP is doing, otherwise the trust and confidence might be eroded.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">SEMBRANO: What exactly Sen. Poe did you want to Gen. Purisima clarify?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">POE: One thing is the going perception that crime and criminality is increasing in our country today. Apparently they have a different statistics, well the statistics say that in fact it is decreasing because the reporting is more efficient now. I'd like him to clarify that. Another thing is how are administrative cases in  the PNP is resolved if there are cases against certain police officers. How did they address it, how is the internal affairs being supported and another thing also is that we were already asking them from the very beginning to submit whatever they needed to have 911 nationwide emergency line. I mentioned it a year ago during our first hearing and until now they are in the process of putting together their suggestions. In fact one of the representatives there discussed what they already have been talking about. They said they are willing to put 10 seats in the call center to take care for the emergency line. Can you imagine 10 seats or 10 operators that would take care of 103 million people, our population. Do you know that our national emergency line is not being handled by the PNP. It is being handled by a foundation, it's not even a government initiative. This is actually unacceptable considering supposedly our country's growth is phenomenal I think we should be able to allot of our budget for something like a national emergency line.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">VELASQUEZ: Sen. Grace Magandang hapon po. Si tony po ito.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">POE: Magandang Hapon, Tony.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">VELASQUEZ: Will you re-extend the invitation to Gen. Purisima if you still need him to face the committee?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">POE: Absolutely, in fact ang ginawa ko kanina Tony I just suspended the hearing meaning we will continue with the hearing regarding the PNP modernization and the state of crime in our country today. Sinabi ko kasi ganito at standard kasi sa mga sulat, pag nagpapadala ka sa mga namumuno ng ahensya na ikaw o ang representante mo ang pwedeng dumalo sa hearing. Ilalagay lang namin yun sa mga namumuno ng ahensya kasi baka magkaroon ng isang emergency sa kanilang hanay, pwede silang magpadala ng representative. Pero siguro kung mayroon ka namang kusang loob at mayroon ka talagang malakas na pananagutan, ang ibig kong sabihin kung gusto mong ipakita at ipatunay at depensahan ang inyong institusyon, pag wala ka naman talagang ginagawang ganong kaimportante, ikaw mismong dadalo. Lalung-lalo na puro batikos na nga ang natatanggap ng PNP ngayon. Gusto ko naman silang tulungan din sapagkat na niniwala ako na kung meron mang mga iilan diyan na tiwali, ay marami namang natitirang matitino na sa tingin ko naman kailangan din naman silang depensahan ng kanilang pinuno na huwag naman din masayang ang tiwala na ibinigay ng Pangulo sa kanya na ipagpatuloy ang kanyang pagiging pinuno ng PNP.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">VELASQUEZ: If the General would decline a second invitation from your committee, do you already foresee what action you should take?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">POE: I don't think that he will decline it the next time. And the reason why I see this is he sent word that there was a miscommunication apparently because it says in my letter that or a representative. Okay, so I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt. And apparently he also sent words that he's willing to attend when scheduled the next hearing, so let me see that. But of course we have some legal recourse in case he decides not to attend the next time. I think we owe our police officers this much. That the head of their agency will come out to defend them or if not defend them would say the reasons why they're not able to perform at an optimum, if they need more in terms of funding for our police officers, if they need more for their logistics. He should be able to come out and defend them. Apparently, for every precinct the national average for maintenance and other operational expenses is P1,000 per police officers. So, if you have a precinct let's say in an area with 5 police officers, you only have P5,000 to take care of the basic needs of the precinct. So, can you imagine, how scarce it is, how difficult it is to have resources, even for their gas allowance, it is so limited. And all of these things, the PNP head could articulate to us and as much as possible if we can include it in the budget, during the budget season we might be able to consider it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">VELASQUEZ: Yeah, that was my next question. Because if the GAA proposal submitted by the DBM may not be sufficient for a better or more efficient police operations per precinct. Is there a an opening for say the DILG to include a request for a supplemental budget within the 2015 GAA?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">POE:  This is something that we can discuss with the finance committee. I know that there are certain items that needs funding that they're able to approve it even after the budget has been submitted as long as it's clearly defined what for, perhaps a category where they can lift the budget from to be able to support these other proposals. But the important thing is, at least we have that option to do it. And that he should at this time come out and try to defend it. Because otherwise, it will definitely be too late. Now, if it can't be included for this coming year, we can start working on it right now. Because there are certain things that we can't just immediately get approval for especially if it is a big ticket item. Or at least you were able to explain it as early as of now, then you can submit all the corresponding studies and other justifications for it. Then, in time for the next hearing you're prepared for it. And I think that we were hoping for that type of leadership or at least that type of initiative from the PNP Chief. But again, I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt, perhaps because we really had miscommunication.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">VELASQUEZ: Senator Grace, just to clarify. When we talk about the facilities or the resources that are at the disposal of each police departments, say within the certain city,  isn't it almost always expected that it is the local government that will provide some of the resources for their police, so given the differences in the capabilities of each local government unit, there are some police departments that are better equipped than other police departments.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">POE: Absolutely, I mean anywhere in the world, there's always that situation because it is a shared expense, the majority of these for certain institutional set-up for the PNP is sanctioned by the PNP itself and that is part of their budget. But for example, extra fuel for their car, sometimes come from the local government. Now the exact definition of, which comes from the local government or the PNP, my knowledge I think is that most of it really has to come from the PNP. And it's just voluntary initiative from the government most of the time to provide for the extras that may not be included in the PNP budget.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">VELASQUEZ: Kasi minsan Madamme Senator, at ito paumanihin na rin siguro ni General Purisima kung nakikinig man siya, kung sinuman sa PNP ang nakikinig, may mga pagkakataon po, may mga nakikita ako na squad car or mobile na police, minsan sila pa yung mas bulok ang hitsura kumpara dun sa mga pribadong sasakyan. Walang headlight. Basag ang tail light. Puro yupi yupi katawan ng mobile. Parang hindi po natin nakikita na naaalagaan po yung mga assets na nabibigay din sa pulisya.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">POE: Yun na nga yung nakakalungkot dun. Kasi yung maintenance ay napakahalaga. Aanhin mo pa ang mga kotse kung wala ka namang pang-repair niyan? Kung nasira, ano ang mangyayari? Kaya ang usap-sauapan, ang sinasabi nila, dun sa malalayong presinto, o dun sa mga ibang presinto na walang pang-mintina ng kanilang mga kagamitan, ang nagmimintina nun ay hindi yung PNP kundi yung masasamang loob. Sila pa ang nagbibigay ng tulong para mapalapit sa mga pulis. Ngayon, dati po yun ay mga alegasyon lamang. Katulad din ng sinabi ni Secretary Mar. Sabi niya, may mga kwento na yung mga low-ranking police officers ay nagkakalap daw ng pondo para ibigay weekly dun sa mga high-ranking PNP officers. Pero nobody daw is stepping forward. Siyempre, hindi naman natin dapat hintayin. We should have a proactive approach to do intelligence works. Sabi ko, anong nangyari dun sa ating internal affairs? Kasi, it seems like we are relying now on the BIR to do the lifestyle check on them when I think that it should be, within the PNP, we should be able to have the confidence that they will be able to also conduct investigations fairly. So, clearly, there is something wrong with the system, it's weak, that's what we should be able to discuss to be able to analyze. And it is important that the head of the agency is present to shed light on the matter. So it's really more of that, we're not accusing him of anything, it is really more of communicating to us, what they need, what we can do to help.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">SEMBRANO: Thanks for clarifying that Senator Poe, kasi nga, a lot of people are asking for the resignation of the PNP chief. Baka yuun ang iniiwasan niya. Baka mamaya siya ang ma-grill. O baka mamaya maging personal pa yung mga inquiry?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">POE: Alam mo yun nga ang mga punto ko dun, iniwasan ko nga, yun nga ang sa akin pag nag-hearing ako, I stick to the issues. Ang problema ko lang talaga, sa tingin ko naman kung wala ka naman talagang itinatago at kaya mong depensahan ang lahat ng mga hakbang mo, dapat talagang magpakita ka dun kasi magandang pagkakataon yun para madinig ka ng ating mga kababayan. Kaya nga pag sinasabi nila, ikaw ba tinatawag mo na dapat mag-resign na si PNP chief? Ako, hindi. Kasi sa puntong ito, gusto ko muna marinig kung ano ba talaga ang mga plano niya. Kasi minsan alis ka lang nang alis ng tao. Pero ang problema pala ay systemic. Balewala din, hindi ba? So, lahat yun ay kailangang pag-aralan. Kaya nga binibigyan natin siya ng isa pang pagkakataon at gusto ko na lang isipin na hindi lang kami nagkaintindihan.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">SEMBRANO: Sana nga po ay sumipot na po si PNP Chief General Alan Purisima. Thank you very much Senator Grace Poe.</p>
