</p>
<!-- NewsBody.start --><p style="text-align: justify">On visiting Senator Enrile</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Nag-usap kami ni Senator Nancy last week, at sabi namin, with the upcoming SONA, it's good that the remaining members of the Minority would visit Senator Enrile and get instructions from him, or guidance from him, kaya kahapon kami dapat ni Sen. Nancy Binay na lang kaya lang pinatawag siya ni Vice President Binay kaya ako na lang ang naiwan. Senator Sotto and Senator Honasan on the other hand, they said that they will accompany Vice President Binay. Yun po ang nangyari. Sana talaga, plano namin, we will go there as a Minority and consult with Senator Enrile for the upcoming SONA.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">On why Senator JV decided to go ahead and not wait for his colleagues to visit Senator Enrile We have to follow protocol. I have already asked permission, I have already written the PNP for permission for us to be allowed so I grabbed the opportunity already, tutal may approval na. nandoon na rin lang ako, tinuloy ko na.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Unahan ko na yung tanong mo, nandoon na ako bakit hindi pa ako pumunta kay Senator Jinggoy. I know these situations, na kapag inabuso minsan, o di kaya yung pagiging courteous ng PNP, ang binabawian kasi minsan ang detainees. So, this time around I wanted to be more careful kaya nga hindi ako basta-basta dumalaw kay Senator Enrile. I made the formal request, hinintay kong maaprubahan. Time comes na ma-schedule ko na yung dalaw ko kay Senator Jinggoy at Senator Bong Revilla, I would want to make a request first to the PNP and the head of the custodial center to allow me to visit both of them. Very soon, siguro next week or two weeks from now, hopefully. When that time comes na medyo feel ko na na medyo pwede na, that is the time I will go to visit.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Yung hiningi ninyong request limited sa pag-visit kay JPE lang?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Yung request ko kay JPE lang kaya doon lang ako nagpunta kahapon and I understand kaya nga medyo naghigpit sila sa custodial center, dahil doon sa nangyari two weeks ago, na medyo nalate yata because of the anniversary. Nag-iingat kasi ako Cely, dahil sabi ko nga, kapag magkaroon ng violations or ano man na paglabag sa visiting hours or protocols, ang binabawian yung detainee. Ayoko namang bawian sila Senator Bong, Senator Jinggoy, kung sakaling dumeretso ako without following the proper protocol.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">On Senator Juan Ponce Enrile</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">He looks okay, he is still in high spirits, his usual jolly self na pag Nakita ka niya, yung hi, hello, kamusta agad. He looks okay, except yung kanyang eyes na lagi niyang kino-complain. Kahit na noong dito pa during the session, he was already complaining about his eyes, na minsan nga nag-aabsent siya because of his eyes. Aside from that, I never heard him complain about anything. In fact, ako nga yung medyo nung Nakita ko yung room niya, nasilip ko, talagang sobrang ang liit. I think it is less than 20 square meters or 15 square meters kasi ang kasya lang talaga yung kama, cabinet tsaka yung kaunting lakaran niya that is why kami po ay we had a meeting outside. Nag-usap kami sa labas kasi talagang hindi kami kakasya sa room niya. Binigyan na kami ng monobloc chairs, at pinayagan naman kaming makapag-usap doon, kasi hindi naman kami talagang kakasya doon sa loob. He was very thankful to all the police officers na kung sino man yung dumalaw doon, yung pinaka head ng health services, si General Advincula at yung iba pang nagmomonitor sa kanya, kapag dumadaan, nagpapasalamat siya lagi.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">On JPE's advise to the Minority bloc</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">I asked him, kasi it has been a tradition that every after the President's SONA, the Minority Leader would deliver a contra-SONA. In this case I asked him if we need to have a contra-SONA, sabi niya mas maganda meron because in a democracy, the rule of the Minority or the opposition is very essential in democratic governance. But I would have to consult Senator Sotto, being the most senior of what is left with the Minority and he is also the assistant Minority Leader, so he would be the Acting Minority Leader. I would want to consult him on this kasi sabi ni JPE it would be good that we have a contra-SONA.  I have also asked my staff to do some research so that in case tasked by the Minority, I would be able to contribute to our research regarding the figures, especially the economic figures that would be mentioned by the President. So I have to verify as a member of the Minority.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">I have not talked to Senator Sotto. I don't know if he is in town already, but we already contacted his office and we asked for a meeting of the members of the remaining Minority, so that we can set already the direction na ngayong apat na lang kami na naiwan dito, hopefully we can set our plans, our directions and strategies on how we will be able to fulfill our role as a responsible and constructive Minority.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Siguro kapag naatasan ako ni Senator Sotto, then I would be willing to deliver the contra-SONA of the Minority. I would just like to tell the President and his men that I hope they would take this constructively. We would just want to play our role as a responsible and constructive opposition so that in the remaining two years of his administration, he could even better improve his governance and accomplishments with the help of the Minority kasi hindi naman natin maaasahan na yung mga pagpuna, o yung mga bagay na hindi nakikita ng Pangulo, hindi naman natin maaasahan na mga taga Liberal Party ang magsasabi sa kanya.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">On what other topics Senator JV and JPE talked about</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Noong nandoon na ako, after a while dumating si Congressman Jack Enrile. After a while dumating din yung kanilang Governor, si Gov. Antonio of Cagayan, so more than half of the time they were discussing matters about the province. He was still very much concerned about his province, he was giving tips to Gov. Antonio on how they can further improve the development of Cagayan. Masyado pa rin siyang concerned sa kanyang home province.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">On the DAP       To implement or identify. Kumbaga binigyan kami ng implementing agency that we just chose kung sino ang magiging beneficiary. But, linawin ko lang, nasabi ko na, na if I am willing to return kung ano man ang worth, hindi ko lang alam kung paano I quantify, kasi nga I milk it na, but if the court says so since DAP is already declared as unconstitutional by the Supreme Court, so, we do not have choice but to follow, and to return whatever we can to the government.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">If JV knew that the money (millions) he received is from DAP</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Hindi e. Narinig ko na lang iyong DAP nasa Senado na ako e. Sabi nga namin, as far as I can remember, my statement at that time, it is the first that I heard about such an animal, iyong DAP when I was already in the Senate. Going back , I just remember that after we voted in the Corona impeachment, after a ffew days, after a week, the staff of the speaker notified that we will be getting additional 10M on top of our 70M PDAF. So, ako naman, being a neophyte, because of my being very excited to bring additional 10M to my District, hindi ko na inimbestigahan, tinanong kung saan nanggagaling ito. Iyon ang pagkukulang. I presumed no funds would come from regular savings and from regular PDAF. Tinanggap ko na lng. Ganoon kasi sa Kongreso, tatanggapin mo so you can bring it to your District. At, para mag pasikat sa aking distrito kaya hindi ko na tinanong.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">If the court ordered you to return the money</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Iyan na lang ang pag iisipan ko lalo na nagamit na nga iyon. It was milk from the national dairy and trainings. I do not know how to quantify those things. Kung meron silang paraan para ma quantify, I am willing to return it since it is declared as illegal. And, kung they want us to return it, we have no choice but to follow and return it out of our pockets.  Actually, wala talagang may alam kung ano ang DAP. I learned about DAP when I was in the Senate. I remember, Senator Osme&ntilde;a said, that it was our first time to hear such an animal. I am very willing to return it out of my pocket, kasi wala talagang may pagkukunan iyon kundi sa pocket namin lang. I am very willing to return it as long as everybody will do the same. My problem is how to quantify it since ang natanggap ko ay goods, hindi po pondo or cash ang aking nahawakan.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Magiging maingat na rin ba kayo sa pagtanggap ng iyong pondo</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Oo, total dito naman wala ng pondo e. Practice more prudence and be more deligent probably in dealing with the different departments during budget season.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Reaction on the statement of Malaca&ntilde;ang that the senators will be the one to explain DAP</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Unang una hindi naman naming hiningi iyon e. Siyempre tinanggap naming para sa distrito iyon e. Hindi naman siguro pwedeng dapat sabihin na dapat managot ang mga legislators kasi voluntarily namang binigay ito ng Malaca&ntilde;ang sa amin. The burden is on Malaca&ntilde;ang, Why don't they release the list of DAP recipients. It is a far cry from the trust of good governance wherein the transparency is one of the factors where we can achieve the trust of good governance. How come the Malacanang doesn't want to release the DAP recepients. How come iyong kay Napoles, ang bilis bilis pero itong list ng DAP ayaw nilang I release.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">On others who won't return the DAP money because it was already used in infrastructures</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">It depends on what the court would decide. In my case, mas maliit naman iyon. Pero kung nagamit na sa infra, I am sure hahayaan na naman ng korte iyon. And, in good faith naman siguro iyon.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">If DAP is being audited by COA</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Yes I think so. Tsini check nila iyan kung na implement. My office also back check if the implementing agencies really implement it. Kasi tulad ng National Dairy, kami ang nag check ng school, sila ang nagdala doon. And, then doon sa training, the manpower department said they conducted the trainings.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">If COA ordered disallowance</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Wala pa naman.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Bakit naisip na ibabalik mo kahit wala pang notice ng disallowance ang COA</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Kasi nga illegal. It was declared as unconstitutional even it the funds are used in good faith we have no choice but to return it. Kaya ko naisip ito na ibalik ito kasi it was declared as unconstitutional. Pero wala pa namang order na ibalik ito.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">SC says hindi naman illegal ang fund per se, ang illegal doon ay ang manner of disbursements</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Well, sa SC na iyan. Medyo jinustify ng konti. Dapat maging specific sana. As A matter of courtesy, I do not want to criticize.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">On whether the legislators should be blamed for receiving the DAP money</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Hindi naming talaga alam. As I have mentioned earlier, I have only found out about that when I was already in the Senate. In fact, when I found that it was illegal... 
I filed a resolution last October 2013 for the investigation of DAP and with the Supreme Court decision declaring it as unconstitutional, I was proven right in my suspicion that illegal talaga 'yun.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">On whether Abad is to be blamed</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Well, it was Abad's decision..., it was Abad's move. Nothing against him but in our government, the President should be surrounded by Cabinet men who are expected to be experts. Kaya nga nilalagay kabinete kasi ang pangulo hindi naman expert sa lahat and Sec. Abad, being a lawyer, being a DBM head before and at present and a former a congressman, he should be expected to be an expert on this and he should have guided the President regarding this matter. With what is happening right now, because of the popularity of the President, for the past four years, itong mga kabinete niya kapag nakakaroon ng issue, instead of shielding the President, it's the other way around. It's the President taking the cudgels and shielding his men. Right now, I think it is already affecting the trust rating of the President. I think for the past four years this is the lowest. So, I think it is about time that the Cabinet men shield the President from the controversies. And since DAP is a very controversial issue, somebody has to be accountable for this.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">On whether it is too early for the Palace to clear Abad on the DAP issue</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">'Yun ng nga nabasa ko rin 'yan kanina that Sec. Abad was already cleared by the Palace. Dapat siguro we should not have double standards... hindi naman dahil dinidepensa ko mga kasama ko sa opposition pero pag taga opposition parang guilty kaagad wala pa naman conviction. Pero pag mga tauhan ni Pangulo at ang kanyang kabinete kapag may ganitong issue o kaya mga kakampi niya sa legislature, eh bago niyo mag submit mga report niyo mamaya bagong mga alas sinco may mga agencies na sinsasabi na cleared sila at walang sila kinalaman. So, if there is an issue, in the trust of good governance of this administration, they should explain and be more transparent. Ilabas 'yong listahan and the recipients. I think Sec. Abad should not hide. He should already explain kung ano ba talagang nangyari at sagutin niya mga issung ito. Ang mangyayari si Pangulong Aquino na naman tatamaan ito dahil he is the one shielding his cabinet from the controversy. Baliktad. It should be the other way around. I think it's about time that Sec. Abad take the bullet for the President kasi he should be the one shielding the President from the controversy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">On whether Malacanang's explanation that Abad is busy working for the 2015 national budget and cannot answer the DAP controversy is plausible</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Parang mahirap paniwalaan 'yun kasi DAP is a very hot issue, it's a very controversial issue. In fact, as soon as the Supreme Court handed out the decision declaring it as unconstitutional, he should have already faced the issue head on. The more that they try to evade the issue, all the more that the public would suspect that hindi nila masagot itong issue. I suggest that they tackle the issue head on, huwag nilang iwasan.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">On the 10M given to the senator and which he wasn't aware that it came from DAP</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">First time 'yun. Actually, 'yun lang naalala kong on top of my regular P70 million. 'Yung ang first, kung mayroon man 'yong mga maliit -liit lang, flood-control for my district at that time kasi national program naman 'yun so na-crecredit 'yun sa akin pero national program talaga 'yon. Pero that was the first on top of my allocation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">On whether it happened again Parang wala naman. Parang 'yon lang naalalako.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">On whether the Senate leadership should explain where the funds came from Wala naman himihingi explanation kasi siyempre gracia 'yon sa distrikto alagan naman kwestionin pa namin. As I said, kung remiss man ako, hindi ako tinanong kung saan nang galing. Ganun naman sa House, especially, kung bibigay ka ng extra funds or projects on top of your allocation talagang thank you 'yon. Dalhin mo 'yon sa distrikto mo 'yon eh, lalo na kung may mga kalaban ka. Lalo na neophyte congressman ako at that time so gusto kong magpasikat, na ang daming ko dala mula sa national government. I don't think anybody would bother to ask. Binigyan na 'yun bat ka pa kwestionin baka bawiin pa.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Dapat kasi sila naman naging conduit, sila naman namigay sa bawat Chamber but it still came from the executive. Sabi nga 'yun cross border transfer of funds 'yun naging basis why it was declared illegal. At that time, I have to be honest with you, I thought the P10 million additional came from the usual naming PDAF. Hindi naman namin alam na itong cross border transfer of funds from another department or other branches of government.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">On the accountability of the funds</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Sa tingin ko we have to file a report. Standard naman 'yun pero kasi 'yun binigay sa amin limitado. There was a menu kung saan lang mga agencies o programa na puwede namin ma-avail. Napili ko nalang na 'yun National (inaudible) kasi mga iba hindi applicable since urban tayo, Metro Manila. Napili ko 'yun National (inaudible) para sa mga students, 'yun iba para sa call center trainings. So, again I want to make it clear na wala kaming pondo hinawakan, wala kaming projects na nagidentify. We just identified the beneficiaries kasi mga implementing agencies na na-implement.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">On returning the money</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Just in case the court so decides that we have to return (the money), I will follow pero sa ngayon wala pa naman.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">On whether he voted to impeach corona</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Opo. Kaya nga ako may DAP.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Q: A few weeks after kinausap kayo ng House Speaker. Anong sabi?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Wala naman basta sinabi lang na meron kayong extra on top of your allocation pero siguro kung titignan mo yung listahan ng nabigyan ng extra it was those legislators who voted to impeach Corona.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Q: Sir, kanina nabanggit niyo na ang mga mambabatas ay walang pananagutan sa DAP dahil boluntaryong binigay ito sa inyo at tinanggap niyo lang. Paano po kung mapapatunayan na may nagpasok ng DAP sa mga Napoles NGOs?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Hindi ko naman sinabing walang pananautan. Ang talagang author ng DAP is the Executive. Kunmbaga recipient lang kami but I think it is still the responsibility of the legislators to make sure that whatever funds were given to them are implemented. Kung meron mang DAP na nakapasok kay Napoles, then I think they have a lot of explaining to do. Hindi rin natin masabi kasi nasa korte na yan. Kung talagang may pumasok doon, dapat sila ay kasuhan whether they are opposition or administration kasi up to now, we have yet to set to see the second or third batch na sinasabi. Hanggang ngayon wala pa ding nakakasuhan.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Q: Dun sa kontra-SONA na hinahanda ng opposition, will you focus on the DAP?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Siguro we will touch on that pero I think what is more important is the economic numbers. The president would report on his accomplishments that we have to verify if the economic numbers would reflect what is really happening. Siguro yung jobs created, meron ba? Yung sinasabi nilang inclusive growth, that is what we want to look into. If its really happening. I just hope that the president would take this constructively considering that he only has two years left in his term to further improve our economic situation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">On DAP as a reward for those who voted to impeach Corona</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">When we were advised that we will be getting additional on top of our allocation, hindi ko na tinanong kung dahil ba yan sa pagboto pero kung sabi ko nga, kung titignan niyo yung listahan nung mga nakatanggap ng 10 million additional sa Housen mukhang karamihan dun ay yung mga bumoto. Yung mga kapartido ko at mga best friend ko sa House, si Cong. Toby, parati kaming magkahiwalay ng boto nun, hindi siya nakatanggap. I would presume na talagang yung mga bumoto in favor of the Corona impeachment were the ones who were able to receive 10 million.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Q: Parang echoing yun sa sinabi ni Senator Jinggoy na bribe siya pero it came after the voting?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">I don't know. Hindi naman ako yung nagaakusa pero that's the timeline. As far as I can remember, a few days after we were advised by the staff of the House leadership that we will be getting additional 10 million on top of our regular allocation. After going through the list, I would say so kasi nga yung kasamahan ko si Cong. Toby who voted against the impeachment ay hindi nakatanggap. Malamang yun na yon.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Q: Walang irregularity sa pagtanngap niyo ng reward if reward nga yun?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Hindi naman sinabing reward kasi basta sabi ko nga sa inyo kanina, kung meron man akong kasalanan, I did not bother to ask kung saan nanggaling at kung para saan. Inaamin ko naman na dun ako nagkulang. Because of my excitement, I did not ask the details.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Q: Bakit hindi niyo po yun tinaggihan?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Naexcite ako na may maiuwi para sa distrito ko. Talagang being a neophyte congressman, nagpapakitang gilas ako that time. I admit to my fault that I was remiss in my duty to verify where it came from and for what purpose.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">On the children's feeding program in San Juan</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Kasi nga limitado lang yung menu. Karamihan ng mga implementing agencies would have to do with agriculture and mga fertilizer. Hindi naman ako pwede mag-fertilizer sa Manila. Ang pinaka nakita ko na applicable sa aming distrito ay yung milk para sa mga bata and yung training dahil very hot ang BPO industry kaya yun nalang ang inavail ko.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Q: Marami bang malnourished na bata sa San Juan?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Hindi naman. Kaysa naman hindi magamit dahil binigay sa akin yun. Ibinigay yun sa akin para maipamudmod sa distrito.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Q: Bakit mag-kontra SONA if sabi ni Tito Sotto matagal nang walang nag-kkontra SONA?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Tradition yan sa House when I was there. I think hindi ko lang alam sa Senate if matagal nang wala. Kaya nga pag-uusapan namin if it is necessary na mag-kontra SONA or not. Sa tingin ko, the Senate being the fiscalizer, especially the minority, would need to have a kontra-SONA. Hindi naman ito para bumatikos lamang or para maghanap ng mapupuna.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Q: Kung ang maging decision ng minority block ay wala na, susundin mo ba yun or on your own ay mag-iinitiate ka pa din ng kontra-SONA?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Kung yan ang naging desisyon ng minority, then we have to abide by the decision. Ayoko naman sabihin na wala akong pakikisama. Pero siguro para hindi naman masayang yung research at lahat ng sinasagawa ngayon, if given the chance, I would like to speak on regarding the SONA.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">On the resolution on the investigation of DAP</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">I think Senator Escudero being the chair of the finance committee conducted the first hearing already before we went on break. Unfortunately, wala si Secretary Abad. Ang dumating lang na parang mga Assistant secretary. With an issue like this, I was hoping that Secretary Abad would face the committee on finance since it was finance where it was referred. Mas maganda sana siya ang humarap mismo. At that time, wala pa namang ruling ang korte suprema nung time na nagconduct ng hearing. Ang pinagtataka ko, bakit ang pinaharap niya sa committee hearing were those under him. Sana naman nagpakita siya ng respeto.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Q: Are you challenging Secretary Abad to face the hearing?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">I hope. Yung kanyang deafening silence is already...&nbsp; Kaya lalong umiinit ang issue ng DAP. Once and for all, address the issue para sa ganun lumalig na. Kaya umiinit kasi hindi sila sumasagot at hindi nila hinaharap ang issue ng DAP. I don't think the asecs and usecs can answer for him kasi I think he is the author of DAP.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Q: Would you move for a subpoena for Secretary Abad?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Meron naman kasing Supreme Court decision regarding DAP. Ang maganda lang siguro is harapin nila or sagutin na nila para matigil na... lalong nagiging mainit kasi iwas sila ng iwas.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Q: Malacanang is claiming that they will survive the DAP controversy. Hangga't hindi nagsasalita si Secretary Abad, malabong mangyari yung they will survive?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">I think they would survive. Hindi pa naman critical yung trust rating. Kaya lang hindi naman yun yung issue eh. Ang issue dito ay yung harapin nila yung action that was already declared unconstitutional. Violating the highest law of the land is probably unforgivable because they are government officials and their foremost duty is to protect the Constitution. Its not the issue of survival but addressing this problem of the illegal act that was done by the Executive.  Korte Suprema na ang nagsabi na illegal ang DAP. So, sino ang may kasalanan? Dapat may accountable, di ba? Hindi naman pwedeng walang accountable diyan.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">On the sacrificial lamb for DAP</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Yes, I think Secretary Abad being the author of DAP. He should be the one sparing the President from this controversy. Ang nangyayari, they always hide at the back of the President. Si President Aquino ang nag-de-defend sa kanyang tao kapag may ganitong issue. Kaya lang, for the past four years, it has been taking its toll. Naapektuhan na ang trust rating ni President Aquino.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">On Palace still trusting Abad</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Wala naman tayo magagawa doon. Siyempre, the President has to trust his men. Kaya lang it has already affected the trust rating of the President. 'Yung sa akin, spare the President from further damage. I think he (Abad) should spare the President from further controversy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">On Senator Jinggoy accepting his visitation request</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">I hope so. I have also to be honest with you that I really felt sad when he was surrendering. Hindi ko akalain na ganoon 'yung kalungkutan na mararamdaman ko. Kapatid ko pa rin 'yan hindi man kami magkasundo. It is more painful for the family than the one who is being arrested. It's something that you don't wish to happen to anyone.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Sabi nga nila, time would heal wounds. I would go when I feel that it is the right time already. I hope he will take the time to read my explanation on my position on the findings ng Blue Ribbon report.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">On the Grace-Chiz tandem</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">That would be a strong tandem considering that they are both young. That would make the 2016 elections interesting. Hindi ko naman po minamaliit ang LP and coming from UNA, if the elections were held tomorrow we will win. At the rate we are going, I am very confident that we will win the 2016 elections.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Among the surveys she (Poe) ranked second. I would think that among other presidentiables, kahit hindi pa siya mag-declare, medyo mataas ang kanyang rating. She's a fresh face. Bago siya.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">We have a political relationship and a personal relationship that we would be considering. We'll just wait and see kung ano ang mangyayari.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">On VP Binay's ratings</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">I think all top officials went down. Nag-peak na siya last year. Nasa 85% tapos bumaba. Ngayon, siya lang ang tumaas. Naalala ko nung 1998, ganoon din kay former President Erap. We are also wary in the opposition right now dahil sinasabi nila na marami pang kaso ang nakaumang.</p>
