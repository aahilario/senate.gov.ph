<span class="PRTitle"><!-- NewsTitle.start -->Transcript of Interview with Senate President Franklin Drilon
<br />
during the Signing of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement<br />
on the Bangsamoro, March 27, 2014<!-- NewsTitle.end --></span>
</p>
<!-- NewsBody.start -->
<p style="text-align: justify">SPFMD: On March 27, after so many years of negotiations, we finally laid down the agreement and this will lead us to the final peace that is so essential to the development of the Philippines, and Mindanao. But as you said, this is only the start of the work for us.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The peace agreement would now have to be submitted to Congress after the President first reviews the agreement as he has stated. Then we will work on the Bangsamoro Basic Law which will be then submitted for ratification by the territories covered by the Bangsamoro.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">It will not be an easy task - as we say, "The Devil is in the details." I expect a lot of debates in the Congress. All I ask my colleagues is that let us all give peace a chance. Let us resolve doubts in favor of peace. Let us put aside our differences, and let us work on a comprehensive agreement with the basic law that will be ratified by our people in southern Mindanao.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Q:  Mr. Senate President, there will be debates and it will be not easy as you said. As the Senate President, what will be at the forefront of your agenda to ensure that the debates are going to be healthy and not detrimental to the process?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">SPFMD: First of all, I will be at the forefront in seeing that our sovereignty is respected. I don't think that the Filipino people will forgive us if we any part of our sovereignty. We must remain as one country, and one nation - as one Filipino people. Whether Moro or Christian, we are all Filipinos. And therefore, it is our moral and legal obligation to preserve our country as one. And that is going to be my guiding principle at this matter. There will be questions on the Constitution no doubt, but we would like to believe we must give the Constitution its most liberal application in order to attain a sustainable and lasting peace.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Q: Last question, Mr. Senate President, because we know that you need to go. Now there will be those who will stall it, and there are those are still against it. What kind of mandate now are you going to give your colleagues regarding these possibilities?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">SPFMD: Those things are expected. In any democracy, especially in a system where you have representatives of the people debating the law, there will always be disagreements. But in the end, our sense of a nation - as Filipinos. We Filipinos are peace-loving people. That at the end will prevail. I have confidence in our Congress that we will all put aside our own personal prejudices and look at the future- a future that is lighted upon by this peace agreement. We will see to that.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The President has promised in very strong and clear language that he will use his political capital to ensure that peace agreement will be a success and achieve peace finally for the country.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Q: The President has been also vocal that before he ends his term, or when he ends his term, he also wants the leaders of the new Bangsamoro political entity elected into office as well if all goes as planned. The question is now are you going to compromise? Is there a sense of urgency here?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">SPFMD: Well there is a sense of urgency. In fact I would expect the President to certify it as an administration concern and subsequently certify it as an urgent measure. But beyond the legal niceties, I would expect him to use his political capital as he has used it in the past in several occasions, when he has perceived it is for the good of the country, and the good of the nation - of the Filipino people. He will not hesitate to use his political will.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">I have worked closely with the President in several crucial legislative matters and he did show his leadership. I expect him to take a personal stake at this peace process for the Filipino people because this will be his legacy. The legacy of President Noynoy Aquino will be the final peace agreement in Mindanao.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">But the work, I tell you, has just begun. We have a self-imposed deadline, in Congress it is December 31, and the ratification would take place in 2015. The transition period would have to take place also next year, so that after the election for the new set of officers for the Bangsamoro, they would assume office by June of 2016, as the president finishes his term.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Q: Thank you very much, Senate President Drilon.</p>
