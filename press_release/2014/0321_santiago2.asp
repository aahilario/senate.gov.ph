<br /><span class="PRSub"><!-- NewsTitleSub.start -->By <br />
SENATOR MIRIAM DEFENSOR SANTIAGO <br />
(Keynote speech at the International Youth Leadership Conference at Samsung Hall, 
<br />
Taguig City, on 21 March 2014)<!-- NewsTitleSub.end--></span>
</p>
<!-- NewsBody.start -->
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 25px">I am thrilled at this face-to-face dialogue with you, as members of the world's largest youth-driven organization conducting, among others, a global internship program among some 124 countries and including some 2,400 universities.   As host country for this year's Asia Pacific Congress, we in the Philippines are honored to welcome each one of you as an international delegate to our country, and to wish you a productive and enlightening conference.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 25px">Basic Characteristics</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 25px">What makes a world-class youth leader? If you lead an organization that is international in scope, does that make you a world-class leader by default? Does the number of Twitter followers and Facebook friends determine who a world-class leader is?          </p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 25px">Here are some indications of youth leaders: </p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 25px">When friends and family seek and value your opinion on who to vote for, or your stand on issues that affect everyone. 
	</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 25px">When you speak your purest intentions in the clearest of voices. 
	</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 25px">When the ripples you make, no matter how small, in your community contribute to the bigger pond outside your borders.          
	</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 25px">World-class leaders have skills and knowledge which set them apart from others, even those who are considered as good leaders. This level of achievement is the result of hard work, experience, and learning. Any person who is educable and willing to study and model the best can develop these world-class leadership skills.</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 25px">1.     Good communication skills</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 25px">Communication is an important strategy necessary for world-class leadership. Really effective leaders set mutual expectations clearly.  They make sure everyone has very clear objectives and performance measures, and check that they understand them.  They are good at planning and at communicating the steps between where the team is at present and where it needs to be.  They give continuous feedback.  They give people goals to achieve, but ensure they have all the support they need from the leader and their colleagues.  They make sure that achievements are recognized.  And they encourage and establish team members' sense of self-belief.[i]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 25px">2.     Developing relationships</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 25px">World-class leaders know the value of creating relationships with employees, customers, suppliers, vendors, and even competitors so that their organization will be more responsive and proactive in meeting the organization's goals and objectives. Strong and effective relationships are based on trust and respect, and help build a positive synergy throughout the organization. 3.     Visionary          The world-class leader is a visionary. Vision is the imaginary place where an organization can go, and it indicates a gap between what is and what can be. Visionary leaders use their leadership insights to develop a vision and convince others to support and help reach the goals of the organization.[ii]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 25px">4.     Adaptive or situational leadership</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 25px">A world class-leader modifies and adapts his or her leadership style to the requirements of the team and situation. This is known as adaptive or situational leadership. On the one hand, if the team is composed of experts and the situation has plenty of time for a collaborative approach, an adaptive leader will allow the team to formulate and implement plans collaboratively, with a minimum of direction. On the other hand, if the same team has a pressing deadline, the leader may have to guide and direct the team more firmly to meet the deadline.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 25px">5.     Skill mastery and transfer</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 25px">World-class leaders have mastered a large skill-set to achieve a high level of performance. Where they haven't, they know enough to acquire these skills from others, or through education, training, and professional development. Further, they have the confidence and skill to coach and mentor their team members, colleagues, and peers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 25px">6.     Teamwork, morale, and cohesion </p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 25px">Excellent leaders have mastered teamwork. Teamwork is focused on producing results in an effective and efficient manner with available resources, and getting the most out of the various backgrounds of the members. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 25px">World-class leaders understand the importance of maintaining morale and cohesion within their organizations. Morale is the steely determination to keep going, despite hardships, obstacles, and failures. When morale is high, the organization or individual will keep focusing on a positive outcome, despite discouragement. Cohesion is the degree to which individuals subordinate their own interests to those of the group.[iii]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 25px">Challenge of the Digital Age          </p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 25px">The digital age has made it easier to motivate and engage people, communities, and even nations. The internet has opened up new horizons for communication and knowledge. Leaders must be aware of the new opportunities and constraints of information and communications technology, and use them effectively.          </p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 25px">Power in the digital age is all about influence. Social media is about having the courage to use your voice to start a conversation, influence people, and bring about social change.[iv]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 25px">Each person has the potential to make a difference and leave a legacy. Building a legacy is not just about people remembering who you were. Here's how great leaders build a legacy: </p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 25px">1.     Know what matters.  You can't leave behind a legacy by accident; and if you do, that legacy will likely be negative. You should know, clearly and unambiguously, what you want your legacy to be. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 25px">2.     Start.  Make the choice to start making a difference. The impact and difference you make on a daily basis will add up to the legacy you leave behind. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 25px">3.     Run your own race.  Be yourself and don't try to be like anyone else. Find and then focus on your personal vision and life purpose, then strive to daily move toward your purpose and potential. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 25px">4.     Find strengths.  Find and maximize your strengths; and overcome your limitations and fears. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 25px">5.     Serve and add value. Starting, running your own race, and finding your strengths all should be to serve and add value to others. The people who leave a legacy have done things that have positively impacted and added value to others.[v]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 25px">The Crimea Event</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 25px">Since you are potential leaders, and since I am a student of international law, let us take this opportunity to discuss briefly the Crimea event.  Crimea used to be part of Ukraine, a country which is geographically adjacent to Russia, and where the local population speaks not the Ukraine language but Russian.  In a recent referendum, where 83% of the Crimeans turned out, 97% of the Crimeans reportedly voted to leave Ukraine and to join Russia.  The government of Ukraine protests the referendum as violative of international law.          </p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 25px">At present, there is no authoritative definition of secession.  In the past, secession was defined as the unilateral withdrawal from a state of a constituent part, with its territory and population.  But today, the definition of secession now implies that secession results in separation, regardless of whether or not the separation happens with the consent of the existing state.  Because of this development, at present there is no authoritative definition of secession.          </p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 25px">Most often in media, the Crimea event is discussed in the light of the previous Kosovo event.  Kosovo separated, despite the opposition of the state of Serbia.  Thereafter, many states in the world promoted the separation because they claim that Serbia had resorted to ethnic cleansing in Kosovo.          </p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 25px">The UN Security Council did not authorize military action against Kosovo.  Even so, NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) and its member states intervened in Kosovo.  Serbia surrendered, and the Security Council authorized an international civil and military presence in Kosovo.  The Security Council ignored the legality of the prior use of force, as well as the final status of Kosovo. At present, the status of Kosovo remains controversial because while some states have extended recognition, others have refused to recognize it.  </p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 25px">The Philippines has not extended recognition to Kosovo.          </p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 25px">The Kosovo event serves to show that, in the words of the writers Daniel Thurer and Thomas Burri: "A non-principled, pragmatic approach is preferred in the domain of secession. . . . The approach means that it is not non-compliance with legal standards that is decisive for the success or failure of an attempt at secession, but rather non-legal factors, such as diplomatic abilities, or the ability to raise international support, or influence the media.  Quite plainly, military power is often crucial. . . ."          </p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 25px">In brief, international law is neutral with respect to secession.  International law neither prohibits nor promotes secession.  The major consideration is mainly political, and this decides the issue of whether a state will recognize the new independent state.  The main service of the Kosovo event is that it motivates other oppressed populations to claim statehood.  </p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 25px">As you can see, like Kosovo, the Crimea event is not a simple case of finding a legal provision in a law book and applying it to the case at hand.  Instead, the Crimea event shows all of us that the structure of the international order is always undergoing change.  For international law is not found in laws passed by an international parliament.  International law develops from the practice of states, supranational organizations, international courts, civil society, minorities, and transnational corporation. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 25px">In some final analysis in the future, the independence of Crimea will depend upon the acceptance of the international community.  It remains to be seen whether the Crimea event will in time give rise to a right to secede from a state.          </p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 25px">Today, Crimea base their claim on the right to self-determination, more particularly on the principle of internal self-determination.  But if so, we have to wait for international practice to develop; meanwhile, the Crimea event does not yet constitute customary international law.          </p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 25px">The three main characteristics of customary international law are: repetition; practice; and opinio juris.  The principle is known in Latin as: "opinio juris sive necessitasis."  This is the principle that for conduct or a practice to become a rule of customary international law, it must be shown that nations believe that international law - rather than moral obligation - mandates the conduct or practice.          </p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 25px">At this time, although many states have recognized Kosovo, I do not think that we have complied with the requirement of opinio juris.  That will be the case with Crimea. At least some states will recognize Crimea as a state within the orbit of Russia, but recognition by others will not amount to recognition of a general right to independence by Crimea.  On the contrary, other states will simply acknowledge the fact that a new Crimean state has come into existence, but without regard on how that state was created.          </p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 25px">Finally, remember that when Kosovo invoked the right to secession, the world had witnessed serious human rights violations in that area.  Many states are unwilling to grant recognition to Kosovo, but they conduct everyday working relationships with Kosovo.  This might differentiate Kosovo from Crimea.          </p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 25px">The modern world has been characterized by what is called "ethno-nationalism." This is the belief that an ethnically pure group is supposed to be the constituent entity or political order.  As a humble student in international law, I am profoundly opposed to the concept of ethno-nationalism, because it violates the basic principles of human dignity and human respect.  In my humble view, ethno-nationalism is incompatible with the principle of self-determination.</p>
