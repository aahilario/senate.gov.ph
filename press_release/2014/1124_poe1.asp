<span class="PRTitle"><!-- NewsTitle.start -->Transcript of Sen. Grace Poe's Manifestations 
<br />
during Floor deliberations on DILG Budget <!-- NewsTitle.end --></span>
</p>
<!-- NewsBody.start -->
<p style="text-align: justify">Sen. Grace Poe:      Mr. President, I am in full support of the budget of the Philippine National Police (PNP) knowing the importance of peace and order to the establishment of greater development in our country. In the Technical Notes on the 2015 proposed National Budget, the DILG is allotted a budget of P141.4 billion, of which P70.9 billion is for the PNP. Naniniwala po ako at may kumpiyansa sa ating mga kapulisan, ngunit may ilan lang po akong nais linawin.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">In the present budget... I think it was asked already by Senator Sotto and I'm glad that he did... so the National Emergency Hotline, you will do a presentation regarding this, am I correct? But right now... Is the number 118 still operational at a limited basis?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Sen. Francis Escudero: 117, Mr. President.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Poe: 117. There's a new number that's assigned, right? 118?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Escudero: Mr. President, they are trying to develop 118. First, in the NCR area, then hopefully, nationwide.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Poe: So, I think that I also received an invitation from the PNP in response to the committee's request for the installation of a closed-circuit television in all police stations in NCRPO. I would like to get an update on that, Mr. President.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Escudero: They will cover that by year-end, Mr. President, your honor. All police stations in the NCR.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Poe: I think the secretary has data? How many exactly are we installing?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Escudero: There are 38 stations in the NCR Area, Mr. President, your honor and all 38 will have a CCTV by the end of the year.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Poe: Now, the CCTV... where will it be situated 
in the precinct? Will it be...</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Escudero: Mr. President, all police stations in NCRPO will have a total of 43 CCTVs that will be installed as follows: 8 CCTVs for SPD, 12 CCTVs for Manila Police District, 5 CCTVs for Eastern Police District, 5 CCTVs for the Northern Police District, and 13 CCTVs for the QCPD to monitor and record all walk-in complainants and to have a view of the overall supervision of the stations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Poe: Mr. President where would the CCTVs actually be situated in these precincts? Will it be near the blotter desk? Near the entrance?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Escudero: Doon sa may desk po...kung saan po yung desk para makita po ang mga lumalapit at nagpupunta sa desk.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Poe: So mayroon naman po silang guidelines kung papaano dapat paandarin ito at kung mayroong kaukulang parusa kung kunwari, nawalan ng baterya o lahat na iyan? Mayroong audit report ng performance nitong mga CCTV dapat.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Escudero: There are guidelines Mr. President. It is not battery operated. Nakasaksak . po sa plug, maliban na lamang po kung mag-brownout</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Poe: So pag nag-brownout, wala pong back-up ito?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Escudero: As of now, Mr. President, wala po.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Poe: Sige, pahingi nalang po ng guidelines tungkol po diyan kasi mahirap gawing dahilan kung kunwari mayroong kontrobersiya tapos sasabihin "Ay, nawalan po kasi ng kuryente noong panahon na iyon."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Yung susunod kong tanong is with regard to the Internal Affairs Service. Because our AA551 states that the head of Internal Affairs Service should be a civilian. And in the past hearings I think we've established... obviously... that it's still not a civilian heading the PNP IAS. I'd like to know their recommendation to finally implement what is in the law and as far as I am concerned Mr. President I think that this should be done because it is the law. And I don't understand what's keeping them from actually appointing a civilian head for this. Mr. Secretary... Would the secretary perhaps have a timeline?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Escudero:  Mr. President, tama po kayo. OIC pa lamang ang nandoon at hindi nga po siya civilian... he is an officer of the Philippine National Police. That position, according to the SILG, is an appointee of the President and they will endeavor to comply, Mr. President, with the provision of the law. It starts with a recommendation, coming from the PNP chief, for a civilian to fill up that position.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Poe: Will the recommendation, Mr. President, have to come from the PNP chief or will this also be from the DILG secretary?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Escudero: From the PNP chief to the DILG secretary to the President, Mr. President, your honor.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Poe: So, that list will only ultimately come from the PNP chief?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Escudero: The secretary confirms, Mr. President.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Poe: Is there a consultation process that's stipulated in the law for the PNP chief to comply with before making a recommendation?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Escudero: The secretary commits to undertake such consultation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Poe: Mr. President... So I'm looking forward to that. May I know, more or less, the deadline they're giving themselves in terms of submitting a recommendation to the President?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Escudero: I'm quoting Mr. President... by year-end, according to the secretary.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Poe: I'm looking forward to that. Welcome development, hopefully. Mr. President, if I'm not mistaken, the ratio of police to the citizens that we're trying to aim for is one police officer to 500 citizens. Am I correct?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Escudero: That's the ideal ratio, Mr. President. Yes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Poe: That's the ideal ratio. So where are we now... is it one to 576? One to 600?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Escudero: We're at one to 605 Mr. President, your honor.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Poe:  Are we trying to aim for a better ratio in this year's budget by allotting for the hiring of new police officers?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Escudero: Yes Mr. President they have 10,000 hirables, Mr. President, next year. That's in addition to the 5,000 already hired this year, Mr. President, your honor.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Poe: Okay. Another issue about our police officers is of course, the sufficient arms and equipment so they could perform their duties with sufficiency and scientific techniques and provided... let's say... with the proper vehicles, transports, arms, communications, etc. Can you highlight, Mr. President, what particular equipment of the PNP will be upgraded and given the proper attention with this particular budget?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Escudero: Mr. President there is a P2-billion capability enhancement fund for year 2015 which is the annual capital outlay broken down as follows, Mr. President, your honor: Patrol Jeeps, single cab, 1,392 units; 9mm pistol, 10,004 units... kasi zero backlog na daw sila, eto yung para sa bagong hire na... 5.56mm basic assault rifle, 3,244 units; 5.56m squad automatic weapon, 84 units; ballistic helmet level 3, 1,506 units; tactical vest level 3 A, 951 units; Waist coast vest level 3 A, 951 units; and explosive detection dogs, 45 units.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Poe: I'm just curious... magkano yung isang aso?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Escudero: P500,000 Mr. President, your honor, is the listed unit price.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Poe: For a trained K9? Hm. Okay. Mr. President, also, recently there has been... With this 2-billion capability enhancement, is the current issue on the Mahindra bid, is this part of this supposed budget?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">P10 billion, so how much will be allocated to the PNP?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Escudero: They will submit Mr. President.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Poe: Mr. President, I would also like to know, this is really important, obviously, about the PNP maintaining peace and order. The crime volume in the Philippines from 2004-2014, ten-year average, seems to be increasing at some point but from 2012 to 2013, there is a jump apparently because of the new reporting system that we have, but can you give me a year to date, if there's an actual decrease. I think this question was asked but I want it for the record. I heard that there's actually an improvement since June.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Escudero: That is correct Mr. President, but they only have the data for NCR. For the period covering for example, June 16 to July 20, robbery, theft, carnapping, and motorcycle napping numbered at 709. For the period covering November 10 to November 16, it only numbered 554. And we have the breakdown Mr. President, your honor. And the lady is correct, the DILG discovered that there was point shaving in so far as the report of the commission of certain crimes are concerned in certain areas hence the increase at the initial onset of this program in so far as the reporting of crimes is concerned.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Poe: I would like to ask Mr. President, what do you think contributed to the decline in crime incidence during this period? What particular reforms were instituted from June until now that actually helped lessen crime?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Escudero: They instituted a multifaceted anti-crime campaign, but to abbreviate it because it is a long acronym, they will make a presentation on it Mr. President, your honor. But I have additional statistics to the inquiry of the good lady. Mr. President in 2013, the total volume of crime was at 846,147. For the first semester of 2014, it has gone down 346,469. For the first semester only Mr. President, your honor. Less than half of what was reported last year.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Poe: That's quite commendable. Would it be safe to say that there are certain reorganization or reassignment of personnel that was done?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Escudero: The secretary confirms Mr. President.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Poe: and will this be upon the recommendation of the DILG Secretary or the PNP Chief?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Escudero: Upon the recommendation of the PNP, Mr. President</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Poe: Well then I commend them for their effort, and I hope that their effort is sustained. Now this was also mentioned by Sen. Sotto, about the PNP personnel that are assigned to government officials or members of congress or senate, recently there was an incident about the family of a publisher of a newspaper who had a run-in with one of these bodyguards. I'd like to know if the PNP chief is aware of it. If he's aware of who the police officers that were assigned to the lawmaker or mayor?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Escudero: According to the secretary, the complainants went to the NBI to file a complaint thinking that PNP personnel were involved, so it is the NBI that is the lead agency in so far as this is concerned. But the PNP at the onset did its own investigation, went to the extent of calling all the security personnel who are members of the Philippine National Police assigned to the mayor, and to present them in a lineup together with other members of PNP. At doon po tiningnan nina Mrs. Pangalangan, that is the case you're referring to, but they failed to identify which ones were actually involved in the supposed incident. So that's where it is right now, Mr. President. They have a report on it, they have henceforth seized, they're continuing to gather on their own but they'll turn over to the NBI because the NBI would be the lead agency in so far as this is concerned. Whatever report that they have, Mr. President, they would be more than glad to furnish the distinguished lady.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Poe: Does the PNP have a master list of police officers who are loaned out, so to speak, for the protection of certain government officials?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Escudero: Yes they do Mr. President, under PSPG. Posible din daw kasi your honor, aside from PSPG detail, baka may mga local police na naka-assign, naka-detail sa ilang public officials. Hindi na po yun saklaw ng listahan na hawak ng PSPG.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Poe:  Siguro tama nga na merong cooperation ang investigation with the NBI kasi kung mayor, merong access doon sa local level ng mga pulis na hindi kasama doon sa  PNP na listahan, tama ba?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Escudero: They confirm Mr. President, but it's legal only in so far as the mayor is concerned Mr. President, your honor, to a certain degree.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Poe: Then maybe we should make it a regulation that any, even local or national, details should actually have a clearance from the chief PNP.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Escudero: They will review and look into it Mr. President</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Poe: At least a memo, and I would like to reiterate the point of Sen. Sotto, that there should be continuing education for these personnel so that they will know, that still above their bosses, they have to maintain respect for the civilians. Yun nga kung ano ang inaasta ng boss, siguro ganun din yung inaasta ng empleyado. Pero huwag nilang kalilimutan ang kanilang sinumpaang tungkulin na protektahan ang lahat ng mamamayan. Now I received communication from the director general of the PNP, and I'd like to thank him with regard to the ownership of a real property in Talisay and his denial. I am making this disclosure, for purposes of transparency and I feel that the budget season is not the correct forum for concerns like this one. So we will forward the submission of DG Purisima to the Ombudsman for whatever purposes. Let me reiterate that leadership by example is always what we're trying to uphold in any institution, particularly the PNP and so we also have to take care of the morale of our police officers. I have great trust in the institution and I know that we owe a lot to the PNP for our protection. So I think that the PNP, DG Purisima will understand if there are certain questions and certain correspondence that he needs to send his to clarify, also to dispel rumors, if they are at all or to give or refute whatever things that need to be refuted, if that is the case.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Mr. President, that is all and I would expect certain data to be submitted to our office or a presentation for further clarification of some of our questions. Thank you, Mr. President.</p>
