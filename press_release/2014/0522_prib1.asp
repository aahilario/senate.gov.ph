</p>
<!-- NewsBody.start --><p style="text-align: justify">On Comelec disqualifying Governor ER Ejercito</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Well, first of all, we are in a government of laws. Siguro, kung talagang mapapatunayan that he indeed overspend. I guess we just have to follow siguro. Ang anggulo lang dito parang sa dinami-dami ng election cases parang laging napapabilis pag dating po sa amin. Sa pamilyang Ejercito-Estrada. If you recall this, 2013 elections pa lamang laging nakaamba halimbawa 'yung disqualification case ni Mayor Erap. Mula noon hanggang ngayon, ilalabas na rin. I think the Supreme Court is deliberating on it. Tapos ako nga ay muntik nang matanggal sa winners circle kahit na the survey is very consistent. I was in the top five at that time so sabi ko baka naman coincidence lang o talagang siguro ganoon talaga ang opposition. Sa ngayon, I hope it's not that a coincidence na nagkasabay-sabay na naman ang disqualification case kay Governor ER, disqualification case naman kay Mayor Erap sa Supreme Court. I hope it's not a coincidence pero parang it's becoming too much of a coincidence na nagkakasabay-sabay.   Hindi naman siguro maaalis sa amin na mag-isip na nagkakaroon ng concerted effort from the administration probably to remove the Ejercito-Estradas. Sana nga coincidence lang.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Alam kong busy siya (ER) kahapon. Sigurado iyon. Hayaan na muna natin siyang ayusin ang mga problema niya. Of course, I'm sure he was harassed yesterday but I'll try to call him probably later or  tomorrow pag medyo nakasettle down na. I 'm just hoping that he would be given the chance to defend his position kasi parang ang daming election cases every year pero parang pag 'yung sa amin na-a-advance. Ang aga-aga nagkakaroon agad ng resolution sa case.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Well, siguro talagang sinasabing unanimous nga. Baka it will create a perception na mukhang talagang mahihirapan talaga siya pero I'm still hoping that in the end, I hope the Supreme Court will still look at the rightful winner. Siguro, ang mahalaga, I think, although sabihin na natin na kung saka-sakali naman na pinag-uusapan natin dito, I think he declared a fund na wala pang two million over. Still, a violation is a violation. I'm hoping that the Supreme Court would look up the will of the people. Kung gusto talaga niya 'yung panalo at hindi naman siguro gaano kalaki. We all know for a fact that everybody overspends. 'Yun nga lang, in my case, I always get surprised every time I see the election expenses that I'm one of the top spenders. Well, in fact, in the last election I was almost off the air for two weeks dahil alam mo opposition kasi kami. Hirap din kami so it will be very hard to imagine that I will be one of the top spenders. Kung titingnan lang natin 'yung frequency of the political ads that were coming up especially last three weeks siguro ang ratio is 1 is to 5 or 1 is to 6. So, baka kami lang ang honest enough to declare what we really spend. Probably, most or majority of the candidates did not declare the real figures of what they spent.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Syempre, hindi mo matanggal sa amin na mag-isip bakit parang laging sabay-sabay  na halimbawa 'yung pagkaka-file ng PDAF case last year. Tapos noong election ngayon naman after kong ma-link sa PDAF buti nalang nagkaroon ng correction as I've said earlier pero  itong laging nakahanda 'yung protest case against for example Mayor Erap sa Supreme Court, tapos ngayon naman kay Gov. ER parang 'yung luck syempre parang hindi maalis sa amin na mag-isip na parang inuubos kami kasi parang laging magkakasunod. 'Yung timing siguro.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">On the disqualification case against Erap</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Noon pa naman maraming kaibigang nagsasabi sa kanya na friends, insiders din, na may kakilala sa Supreme Court. There was that time noong hindi pa lumalabas sa print, sa news that they would really try to disqualify him. Tapos, ang sabi, I hope It's not true, that there was really an instruction already from above whatever that means na sana lang hindi totoo.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Hindi ko nga alam. Even if former President Erap ran against President Aquino knows the fact that we remain supportive and cooperative every time there is a crisis that his administration would be facing. Former President Erap is one of those who would defend President Aquino right away. During my stay in the House of Representatives, I could clearly remember that every time there is a crisis tulad ng hostage crisis dito sa Manila among others. I would speak and defend President Aquino ahead of his party mates of Liberal Party kaya lang kahit anong gawin namin parang baliwala but I hope that they would know we are good allies and kami naman for what is the good of the country. We tried to set aside political colors especially during the recent Yolanda tragedy in December when I'm the one who said that we should avoid having political colors this time. The President should lead and all the rest should follow. So 'yun lang, hindi talaga kami type kapag hindi kami part of the circle.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Just remain strong for your family. And, of course, as a family member I feel sad. I feel bad especially with what they are going through. I know, as I have said earlier, I know how it feels. And, I completely understand their situation. But, be rest assured, we will take care of the family on whatever capacity we can.  As I've said the eldest daughter is now a councilor. We've learned how to be closed to her. My mom and I, we talked and we are concerned also that we see her bothered. We also feel bad because we see her bothered because of the situation. In our capacity, we will try to make her more comfortable and I hope she can find respite in the company of the family. We are family.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">On the case against the three senators</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Because I do not want to pre-empt. Sabi nga ni Senator Bong, parang pinapakita na may kulungan sila at para na silang tino-torture. So, we are still hoping. I am hoping as a brother and as a colleague that they will still be given a chance to defend themselves. The proper forum will be in the courts. Sana tama na ho dito. Anyway, we are not here and say that they are guilty.  The little that I know of Senator Bong, not to defend him, and Atty. Gigi during my term as a mayor, they helped me a lot. Kasi during that time I was in the opposition. And, they helped allocate some PDAF to San Juan. Iyong mga street lights namin, sabi ko wala akong pondo and at that time wala akong maasahang tulong sa administrasyon. They helped me. And, just to be fair they never asked for anything. I mean, this was my personal experience. Just to be fair. I hope that they really can defend themselves.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">On Senator Jinggoy's guilt</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Mahirap din sagutin iyan. Kapag sinabi kong hindi ako naniniwala, sasabihin ng mga sa social media at kung sinu-sino man diyan na I am defending them outright. Like I said, as a brother and as a collegue, I just hope that they be given a chance to defend themselves. And, we are in the Senate or the Blue Ribbon Committee for that matter, were not here to judge them. That judgements whether they are guilty or not has to be given to the courts. That would be the proper forum. I do not want to comment on that.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Subukan niya munang basahin or kung anuman ang naging posisyon ko at kung meron mang nangyaring mga issues, alamin muna hindi iyong outright magagalit. Just to give you an example, siguro marami sa inyo ang nakasama naming sa campaign trail, lumabas iyong isang istorya sa isang network na inisnab ko si Janella. His daughter is running for councilor in San Juan under my mom's ticket. In one of the political meetings, nilabas pa na parang inisnab ko. Good thing that we had a copy of the video showing that it was not true. So, bago sana mag presscon siya noon dito at bago siya nagsabi na masakit sa kanya ang ginawa ko noon, sana tiningnan muna ang ebidensiya. Kung nakita iyon sana wala tayong isyung pinag-uusapan. Siguro, I just would like to relate it to the Blue Ribbon report, that if had he read it, my explanation of my decision to sign the Blue Ribbon committee report, I think he would understood my postion. Iyon lang. Hope he tries to understand first before concluding.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">On allegations that Malaca&ntilde;ang maneuvered the report when they found out that they have allies involved in the PDAF scam</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Noong unang lumabas din ang list, I was excited just like anybody else to see who are in the list. Kaya lang biglang may lumabas na dalawa, tatlo, apat at lima na list, I think, whoever has that intention really intends to muddle the issue. Sa pagkakasama ko nga lang sa isang list, I think, that is one intention to muddle the issue. Nagpapasalamat na lang ako na na-clear ako after being a week na naipasama ako sa listahan. Kaya lang, because of that, probably the credibility nang ibang listahan ay mababawasan.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Congressman Toby Tiangco, has a point, siguro ayoko naman mag -accuse ng mga taga Malaca&ntilde;ang, kasi baka naman sa mga lumabas na pangalan doon ay meron namang kinalaman. Sabi ko nga noong una e, nagtataka ako na hindi ko naman kilala si Napoles ay nandoon ako, iyong ibang kilala si Napoles ay wala naman sa listahan.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Siguro, baka may point nga si Cong. Toby, na when they found out that some of their allies are in the list, siguro nagkaroon na ng issue to muddle the issue. I do not want to conclude na it is the Malaca&ntilde;ang. I think, given the situation that a lot are coming up with their own list. I do not know anymore which one to believe. Siguro, all I am asking, because I was one of those victimized, na wala talaga akong kinalaman at inosente talaga ako. I would say that damage has been done. For a week, my face, my photo was always on TV. Of course, iyong aking reputation ay affected. Water under the bridge.  At least, nagkaroon na ng clarification. I hope that those in authority who have the list or whoever, please be more prudent this time. Kasi kawawa naman iyong sa listahan nila na basta na lang ilalabas. Paulit-ulit kong sinasabi na sana man lang may documentary evidence before making the list public.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">On filing a class suit against a newspaper</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Mukhang nabasa ko din iyon.  There is a suggestion from a lawmaker to file a class suit kasi marami sa kanila ang biglang  nadamay. Kaya nga sabi ko nang lumabas ang listahan, confident ako na magulo itong listahan kasi marami doon na lawmakers coming from the 12th to 14th Congress.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">On PDAF</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Actually, he called me after I submitted the Blue Ribbon report with my signature, including the explanation of my decision. Tinanong niya, "Oh, balita ko pumirma ka raw," Sabi ko oo, with reservations. Then I said that in my explanation, I was not contended with the report which focused on the eight Napoles NGOs. I indicated in my explanation that if we are really serious in fighting and getting to the bottom of this mess, in fighting graft and corruption, then we should investigate all 80 bogus NGOs which was named by COA. So, 'yun ang aking explanation. And I told him that I consulted Sen. Enrile, who was my seat mate, and I told him about my plan to sign with reservation and with corresponding explanation. Sabi sa akin si Enrile, "Tama 'yan. Bakit sila sini-single out, bakit sila selective, dapat talaga lahat." I guess Sen. Enrile understood my intentions and I think it came out in the papers that sabi ni Erap na alam ko naman daw ginagawa ko at tama naman 'yun explanation ko of having to continue with the Blue Ribbon hearing and investigate all suspected bogus NGOs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">On informing Senator Enrile and Senator Bong Revilla regarding his intention to sign the Blue Ribbon Committee report</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Sen. Enrile, being the minority leader, of course I have to tell him and then si Sen. Bong naman, I get the chance to be with him because we go trailing once or twice a month so during the lull, nagkukwentohan kami, sinabi ko sa kanya 'yun plano ko. Probably I just didn't get the chance to tell Sen. Jinggoy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">I think my signing added fuel to the fire but unfortunately, he didn't try to understand first. But I'm very positive that if he could have read my explanation, he could have understood my position. And I guess, those are the positions that he would have taken also. Naririnig ko mga interviews nila and sinasabi nila, "Eh bakit kami lang, hindi lahat?" Eh parehas lang naman sa sinabi ko sa sinulat ko. Wala dapat reason sila para magalit kasi kung ano sinasabi nila, 'yun naman din sinabi ko sa explanation ko.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">If I don't sign, maraming magagalit and if I sign, maraming magagalit din. So in the end, I just have to trust my own judgment. As I said, I always remember that I am accountable...I'm a newly elected senator, just a year ago, and I will always have to remember that I was put in this position by the electorate who entrusted me their confidence so I would always put more weight in my accountability, more than my responsibility as a party member or as a family member. So my accountability would play a big factor in my decision but I hope I make it clear that the reason that I signed with reservation, it means that I don't entirely agree with the Blue Ribbon report. As I have said, I found it incomplete and that we should continue with the hearings, investigate all, 'yun ang position ko.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">On his relationship with Senator Jinggoy after he signed the Blue Ribbon Committee report</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Hindi naman din kami masyadong nag-uusap to be honest, ni Mayor Erap ngayon. Kaya lang 'yun nakita ko tumatawag siya within 30 minutes after I signed the Blue Ribbon Committee Report, alam ko na ano 'yun. Baka mayroon pa siya tao dito. Sabi ko, "naku, ito na 'to." Unang bungad niya sa akin.."Oh, pumirma ka raw. Sabi ko oo, pero kinonsulta ko naman si Sen. Enrile, then I explained what was written in my explanation. Tapos sabi niya, "sige." I was expecting it, that he would not like it. But I was also surprised that in one of the interviews that I read that he said that I'm old enough to know what I am doing and that the decision I made was right. I'm hoping that he'd understood.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">As regards to my relationship (with Sen. Jinggoy), it has improved before. At least hindi na kami masyadong nag-aaway before kaya lang nakikita niya na hindi kami masyadong close, hindi kami chummy, chummy...mas lalo ngayon sa nangyari. Kasi may understanding.  Ang akin lang, kung binasa ang aking explanation, I think he would have understood. Kaya lang ang problema, hindi pa binasa, galit na. 'Yun ang problema.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">On whether he is hoping that Senator Jinggoy will not be jailed</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Definitely. Kahit hindi kami nag-uusap, kahit hindi kaming close, he is still my brother, maka-dugo kami. I feel bad of his predicament right now, I know how he feels. We went through that already in the past. For him to go through this again all over again must be very hard, especially for the family. I feel for his family, especially Jannela, who is now councilor, who's very nice to my mom, very nice to me.  I just hope that they continue to pray, my prayers are with them also, just be strong. Siguro all I can say is that when everything is going against you there's nobody else to lean on except the Lord.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">On his relationship with Senator Jinggoy Estrada</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Even during the presidency of our father, na-publicize na rin an gaming rift. It just worsened because of local politics. I had my people. He had his. So, alam niyo na, kapag local politics, lahat na-ma-magnify. As far as I can remember, during the darkest moments of my family, when my father was overthrown, it was one of the most difficult times for everybody. There was a time, probably because of our misery, our depression, that we became close. Who knows? If a situation like that comes, he would know that there's nobody else to lean on except family. 'Yung mga friends natin, political allies, alam natin 'yan, kapag wala ka na, wala na rin 'yan. The family, whether you like it or not, we are there. There will come a time, I hope, we will realize that we are brothers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">On Janet Lim-Napoles</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">I never had the chance to talk to her or even greet her. I probably saw her probably twice in social gatherings. But in our family affairs, I never saw her there. All I know sa relationship niya sa family is through the pictures that were shown. That's it. Walang formally nagpakilala sa amin.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">For security reasons, we understand why she can't be brought to a regular city jail. That, we understand. That's the rationale for her staying in Fort Sto. Domingo alone.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">On Napoles' affidavit</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">If there's documentary evidence, it would be better if it's accompanied with other proofs that indeed there were transactions between a lawmaker and Napoles. Like for example, a copy of a SARO, cheque, that will prove that a transaction was consummated. For a list again to make public, without proof attached to it, I'm against it because I was already victimized. I hope they don't victimize other people. I hope they'll be more prudent.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">On his future political plans</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">I am not really an ambitious person. Okay na ako dito. I'm already happy. It's already a privilege and an honor to be a senator. We're only 24 privileged people all over the country. To get here, is already something.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">On the vice presidential candidate for UNA</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Wala pang napag-uusapan. Mayroon ng shortlist din. 'Yung huli naming pinag-usapan is mga senatorial candidates. Marami pang mangyayari. We still have two years to go. Probably, there will be political alliances. That party may demand that they get the VP position. Malamang ganoon kaya malabo ring mangyari na taga-UNA ang VP candidate.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">On Andrea Rosal</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">I feel for her. She's also human and she's a mother so I hope that the government would be more sensitive and show more compassion. I support that she be allowed to go to the funeral at least. Kung ano 'yung kasalanan ng ina, hayaan na muna nating she pays respect to her daughter.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">On Janet Lim-Napoles' hospitalization</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">It's the discretion of DOJ kung kailangan 'yung mga sinasabi nila. If it's the doctor who talks, wala tayong magagawa doon kapag medical condition.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">On Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Kay GMA, I would support that she be given medical attention abroad for humanitarian reasons, I guess wala po tayong pag-uusapan doon.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">On Senator Jinggoy's SALN</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Senator Jinggoy is seven years older than me and he started his career earlier. May negosyo siya, sa showbiz siya so he had seven years headstart to save for his family.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">On the Globe Asiatique investigation</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Sen. TG Guingona wrote a memo that I would be tasked to chair the hearings regarding the Globe Asiatique-Pagibig scam. The Blue Ribbon Committee will write again to the courts to allow Delfin Lee to attend the next hearing. Ang problema ngayon, I think, is that the plenary sessions will be used next week for the Malampaya scam. After next week, I think we will be able to take on the Globe Asiatique.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Delfin Lee is already under the jurisdiction of the court. We have to respect that jurisdiction. The Blue Ribbon Committee will try to facilitate Delfin Lee's appearance.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">It was the judge who turned down the request. Hindi kami nag-issue ng subpoena because we respected the court.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">On the PDAF Scam</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">This would not originate from the legislators or the Senate. Ang alam ng pagtakbo o yung proseso, yung paggagalaw ng papel, mas alam po yan ng Executive Department. That's why siguro kung maaalala niyo, paulit ulit kong tinatanong kay Ginang Napoles, kay Benhur Luy at sa iba pang resource persons kung sino ang kanilang mga kausap in the Department of Budget and Management, the implementing agencies. Sino yung kanilang mga kakuntsaba? Sino yung talagang kanilang koneksyon? Yun yung mga dapat natin ma-establish. As legislators and for us to outline or draft a bill to prevent a course of such, we need to know who they were coordinating with. Mas importante sa akin 'yun. Mas alam ng nasa DBM, COA and implementing agencies yung takbo ng papel. Within my experience in the House, pag sinabi , to be fair to my colleagues there before, ng DBM na hindi allowed, hindi naman pinipilit eh. Sinusunod naman ng legislator. I would not say that the legislator is not only to blame. Malaking parte dito tingin ko ang participation ng Executive department. Ako, naniniwala ako, meron sa DBM niyan, meron sa COA at meron sa implementing agency.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">I think it is unfair. Kagaya ng sinabi ko , mga legislators don't like details. Takot sa mga liquidation yan. Kaya nga legislator yan, ayaw ng Math.  Ang talagang magagaling dyan, ang tingin ko na may kinalaman sa conspiracy na ito ay yung mga nagpapalakad at yung nagppropose ng proseso ng papeles. Malaking factor yun. I think that would be more than half ay yung pagpapatakbo ng papel.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Q: Are you saying na ang mastermind ay nasa Executive?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Sen. JV: Hindi naman. That remains to be seen. Pero sa ngayon ang ina-allege na mastermind is Janet Napoles but I would say one of the conspirators. I'm sure one of the conspirators would be one in the Executive department. Whoever it is, we do not know because even the whistleblowers, they do not want to identify any.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">On the Senate President Drilon's signing of the subpoena             Hindi naman siguro hinarang. To clarify, nung nagkaroon din ng confusion kay Delfin Lee, nung lumabas yung subpoena, Senate President Drilon talked to me sabi niya 'Uy, wala akong nakukuhang subpoena on my desk.' If there is any subpoena on my desk, I would sign. Yun yung experience ko, pipirmahan niya pag meron siya.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Hindi naman siguro. Mahirap naman magsalita for him. Tanungin nalang natin si SP. But for me, in my experience I don't think he would hestitate to sign any subpoena kasi nga nung nagkaroon ng confusion, willing siya pumirma agad ng subpoena para kay Delfin Lee.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">On the controversies against the Estrada family</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Kanina napagusapan na yan. Sana nga coincidence lang na nagkasabay sabay yung mga kaso, yung kay Gov. ER, yung disqualification case kay Mayor Erap tapos itong PDAF kay Senator Jinggoy. Ako naman ay positibo na malalampasan at sana naman ay yung mga may kaso ay madedepensahan nila ang kanilang sarili. Ayoko naman isipin na ako lang ang maiiwan pero saka nalang po yun. Pag sinabi kong matutuluyan ang lahat, baka pati tatay ko ay magalit sa akin.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">On the anti-political dynasty bill</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">This will be a historic moment. Probably this would be the first time in history that an anti-political dynasty bill would reach the plenary and the House. Right now, we are in the process of hearing it this afternoon. We have our second scheduled hearing on the anti-political dynasty bill which was filed by yours truly. Totoo yun, baka mamaya magkaroon ng ibang pagiisip yung ibang nasa political dynasty kagaya namin. Kaya lang ang rationale ko kasi don ay napag-isip isip ko na umaabot na tayo sa halos isang daang milyon, ang atin pong populasyon and I've always believed that power whether economic or political, should not be confined to just a few. Sa dami ng Pilipino, naniniwala ako na madami din diyan ang may kakayanan, capability at malinis ang intensyon. Siguro ay hindi lamang nabibigyan ng oportunidad. Hindi na nabibigyan ng pagkakataon dahil wala silang pangalan. Yun yung rationale. Siguro panahon na para mapagbigyan na yung iba na may kakayanan na mamuno naman. Hindi naman natin totally, shinushut out. Dun po sa aking panukala, halimbawa, ako po ay Senador, ako ay national official, hindi pwedeng tumakbo ang sinuman pong aking kamag-anak in the same district or province because I would be able to wield influence. Magagamit ko yung aking posisyon para makatulong sa kanilang area. Yun nalang ang paguusapan.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Q: So bawal na ang magkapatid sa Senado?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Sa bill ngayon, mukhang bawal na. Kaya siguro, huli na siguro yung pagkakataon na makikita niyo yung meron nagkakatampuhan, merong nagmamahalang magkapatid.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">On the World Economic Forum</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Well, malaking bagay yan. Para tayo makapaghost sa World Economic Forum, I hope that we will be able to showcase the best our country has to offer but we just have to face reality also that we have to review and study even if the country is projected to be serious in fighting graft and corruption, the thrust of good governance and the improvement of the credit ratings, how come we are still lagging behind in terms of foreign direct investment. If you would compare to the ASEAN, wag na sa Asian, within ASEAN na tayo ay automatic na dapat nasa top 5, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, dapat tayo ang kasunod dun, Singapore, we are now number 7. Mukhang nalampasan na tayo ng Cambodia, Vietnam especially. I think we have to do an honest to goodness review of policies and analyze how come we are lagging behind. Probably, all I can say is we have big problems like infrastructure, we are lacking. I commend the president for his thrust of good governance and for improving our credit rating. We need the necessary infrastructure, for example yung power. Not unless we have a blueprint of the power industry in the next 10-30 years, we will be able to entice and invite investors. The problem right now, not only is power generation very expensive in the Philippines, we are now facing power shortage come 2015. These are the realities that we are now dealing with. Hindi naman pwedeng panay honesty and good governance lang. Kailangan meron ding performance. I hope that the president would take this positively. Wag siyang maging sensitive. Pag may pinuna ka, magagalit agad. I just hope he could take this constructively. There's two years left.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">On his assessment on his first year in the Senate of the Philippines</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">I have to be honest. At first, I was excited to be one of the 24 privileged ones. To be one of the 24 is already an achievement. I came at a not very good time where the institution is facing a very tough crisis. Probably the toughest in history. I am very optimistic. I just hope that this is just a cleansing process and I hope that if we get through this, we will be able to regain the people's trust in the future. Siguro, what would be good now for the present Senate is that we have a lot of young guys who came in, new blood, new faces. Hopefully, this would help in changing the image of the institution.</p>
