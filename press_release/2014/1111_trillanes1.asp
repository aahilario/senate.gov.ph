</p>
<!-- NewsBody.start --><p style="text-align: justify"><p style="text-align: justify">Pinky: Did you think this is gonna happen, Sir?</p> <p style="text-align: justify">SAFT: In a way, I was expecting that, but I was really hoping against hope that he would somehow find the courage to live up to his word, but we can't expect too much from this guy.</p> <p style="text-align: justify">Pinky: How would you describe that the Vice President, everything being ironed out for the November 27 debate and today on his birthday backed out, sir?</p> <p style="text-align: justify">SAFT: I really don't know what happened, but last week when I set the deadline to 22 of November, they probably thought I wouldn't bite the November 27 date that they said, but I bent backwards again just so that this debate will push through, and they thought that they can impose other conditions that will make me back out, but again I bent backwards. They imposed this condition that they will be the first to give the opening statement and the last one to give the closing statement and that really put me at a disadvantage, but nonetheless, I expected again, just hoping this thing would push through but when they realized, probably, that we're really very serious about this matter, ge couldn't muster enough courage to face me, even in a debate.</p> <p style="text-align: justify">Pinky: Would you in a way find blame in yourself, Senator, because the Vice President is saying that, basically he was saying ang dami kasing naging siguro pananalita coming from your end na hindi po kayo abogado, he has the upperhand, dahil po naman right lawyer siya at abogado siya, kaya ang sinabi po niya kay Dennis Datu kanina po on DZMM, he was saying that ayaw niyang mag mukha na mapang-api siya kaya mas mabuting mag back out nalang siya sir.</p> <p style="text-align: justify">SAFT: That's the lamest excuse you can ever get from anyone. In fact, for somebody like him na gustong gusto niya nga bumawi, that was the best opportunity to put me in my place, diba? Pero alam niyo nobody is going to buy that. Nobody's going to buy that.</p> <p style="text-align: justify">Pinky: Are you, at least, I mean looking back, do you think maybe it was better kung wala nalang ho kayo sigurong sinabi para hindi magkaroon ng rason si VP to backout?</p> <p style="text-align: justify">SAFT: No. The reporters were asking me and stating it as a fact because no matter how you look at it, he's at an advantage which is why I'm also trying to study and learn how to debate because I'm not going in there without putting up a good fight. But even if I didn't speak at all, I will tell you, they will come up with a reason not to show up in that debate. So, this is just one of those alibis that the Binay camp has been dishing out to everyone. It's one lie after another. In fact, if you just review your tapes there in ANC and listen to all those statements made by the spokesmen of the Vice president, you'd see how many lies they have given us and they are really taking us for a ride.</p> <p style="text-align: justify">Pinky: Paano ho kaya, I mean, would you say that to describe how you feel, disappointed, sad, angry that this is not pushing through?</p> <p style="text-align: justify">SAFT: No, actually I'm ambivalent still about the matter because it's his loss. He blew up this opportunity. He's going to be crucified for this and he practically destroyed whatever credibility he has left in his body. Yes, so that's what I'm feeling right now. Actually, I'm, in a way, expecting this, so, I couldn't be disappointed.</p> <p style="text-align: justify">Pinky: You thought somehow, at some point, this wasn't gonna push through. There was a nagging feeling, sir.</p> <p style="text-align: justify">SAFT: Yes, yes, but still I was focused. I studied and I tried to learn the basics of debating because it's not going to be a loss, I'm sure I'm going to need this skill someday in the future.</p> <p style="text-align: justify">Pinky: Well, so it's not pushing through, and it's not a surprise for you. You know, yesterday Senator Nancy Binay was also interviewed and she said that you know, from the very beginning, together with Congressman Toby Tiangco, she wasn't really keen on you know, this face to face with Senator Antonio Trillanes. Basically saying of course that she doesn't know and she doesn't understand or she doesn't believe and agree why her father should stoop down to the level of Senator Antonio Trillanes. What's your reaction to that sir?</p> <p style="text-align: justify">SAFT: You see those statements are irrelevant. Her father was the one who challenged me, her father should have thought of all those things, but the challenge was made and the challenge was accepted, so here we are. All those statements leading to today, to this statement today, you can see that they're laying the ground for an eventual pull out from the debate, and exactly, as predicted, this has happened, but they are going to be crucified for this and they should be crucified for this.</p> <p style="text-align: justify">Pinky: But that's what the vice president was saying. It was on the headlines a few days ago, or maybe even a week ago that he is being crucified with all this Senate investigation, sir.</p> <p style="text-align: justify">SAFT: Well he's being crucified because of all those sins that he has committed against the people and again as stated in an earlier interview, all those lashes that he will be getting, are just what he deserves for committing all those sins against our country.</p> <p style="text-align: justify">Pinky: So moving forward, what happens, of course, this does not  have really anything to do with the sub-committee hearing by the Senate Blue Ribbon, so what's going to happen with that now? What's next?</p> <p style="text-align: justify">SAFT: We will push through with the investigation. Nothing has changed and in fact this was the best opportunity for him to make his explanation to the people. He said he can't do that in an environment like the Senate, then this one is a more controlled environment, with all eyes on him, so this was his best chance, but he blew it.</p> <p style="text-align: justify">Pinky: Okay, so Senator thank you so much. It was a much awaited debate, but unfortunately it's not gonna happen for you know  the vice president has reasons and he did already enumerate and identify the reasons for him backing out of this debate Senator Antonio Trillanes, so I guess you're going to stop training and studying to be part of this debate.</p> <p style="text-align: justify">SAFT: I'll probably just finish the first base which is learning the basics because I believe it's going to be a good skill that I'm need to have.</p></p>
