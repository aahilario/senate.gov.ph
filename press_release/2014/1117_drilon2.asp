<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 25px">Today, we are gathered in this august chamber, bound by immense grief at the passing of a highly respected, deeply loved, and widely remembered public servant, Senator Juan Martin Flavier.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 25px">With profound sense of loss and sadness, I extend my deepest sympathies to Susan, Jondi, James, Johnet and Joy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 25px">Although he was the first one to make a joke of his height, Johnny was a giant of a man. His monumental achievements made him stand out from the rest. But what made him more extraordinary was his strong compassion for those who have less in life, his sense of duty, and commitment to make a difference.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 25px">Throughout his journey, from being a barrio doctor, to Secretary of Health and to Senator, he consistently championed the poor and sick. As Health Secretary, he introduced novel approaches to health care, such as Oplan Alis Disease, Sangkap Pinoy among others, which were successful and widely praised by the World Health Organization and health practitioners. His "Doctor to the Barrios" program inspired young doctors to leave their comfort zones, and the prospect of lucrative practice in the city to administer to the poor, sick and ailing in the rural areas.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 25px">In the Senate, he authored landmark legislations, such as the Traditional Medicine Law, the Poverty Alleviation Law, Indigenous People's Rights Act, among others.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 25px">I nominated and worked with him as Senate President Pro Tempore. He tirelessly pushed for reforms in health care delivery, regulation and financing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 25px">He will always be remembered for passionately and courageously advocating for a reproductive health law despite strong opposition from different sectors. That law was finally passed two years ago, and we dedicate it to his memory. The passage of the Reproductive Health Law is a fitting tribute to him.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 25px">Johnny was a well-loved colleague, who peppered every committee hearing with his stunning humor and sharp analysis of issues. His diligence, humility, character, integrity and rock-solid determination to pursue his advocacies held all the members of this august chamber in awe.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 25px">Johnny left an indelible mark in the lives of people he crossed paths with.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 25px">He was a gem of a friend -- a man I highly respected and deeply admired.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 25px">I remember during the 1995 campaign as so clearly described by Serge, he had a miniature Flavier T-shirt which he would throw to the crowd at the end of his speech. Do you remember that, Serge, that little T-shirt? His self-effacing humor made everyone afraid to speak after he had spoken. Malas ka lang sa kampanya kapag ikaw ang susunod na magsalita kay Johnny Flavier, dahil hindi na makikinig ang tao, ang iba, umaalis na. Johnny's innate charm, and wit, never failed to conquer every stage he stepped on. He captured the hearts of millions of people who heard him dish out his signature anecdotes. He was the quintessential communicator, who had a knack for delivering serious messages in a lighter, but in a certainly more effective way.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 25px">How can we forget his "yosi kadiri" campaign? It was the public support and consciousness that this slogan generated which enabled us to pass the Sin Tax Law on cigarettes and the Graphic Health Warning Act on cigarette packs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 25px">Sadly, during the 1995 campaign, he was singled out by anti-reproductive health advocates who cast aspersions on him. However, his detractors underestimated Juan Flavier.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 25px">That small guy had nerves of steel, and iron will.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 25px">He was unfazed by all the mudslinging, and went on to place fifth among 12 winning candidates. Six years later, he ran again for re-election, placing second. His amazing achievements in the polls underscored the people's overwhelming trust and confidence in his capability and moral authority.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 25px">I have collected fond memories of Johnny, having worked with him for more than a decade. I will never forget that he always made himself available every time I went to his office, which was across mine, to make small talk, and share my thoughts after a full and grueling day. My wife, Mila, and I always had a great time with him and Susan. He never failed to make my day with his funny one or two-liners.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 25px">Johnny did not only inspire people to give their best in public service. He also brought so much joy and laughter to those around him. Known for his quick wit, and ready repartee, he spared no one from his brand of humor. I can only imagine the chuckles he drew from people every time he referred to me as "Mila's lechon."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 25px">And today, I gave the permission of Susan to tell you a little episode in my life, when I was Senate President, somebody gifted me with two barong materials. I liked it so much, so I gave Johnny the other barong as formal wear. That is the barong which Johnny is now wearing in that picture. It is indeed a memory that I will always treasure.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 25px">The members of this august chamber and I are privileged to have known him, and have laughed, walked and worked with him. His memory will live forever in the hearts of countless people whose lives he deeply touched. His life and work will continue to inspire men and women to leave their comfort zone and make a difference in the life of those who have less. His legacy is cradled in the bosom of a grateful nation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 25px">Today, we honor Juan Martin Flavier, an extraordinary man who, in his lifetime, had always pursued the road less travelled. We celebrate his life even as we feel a collective sense of loss at his demise. It is not easy to bid him farewell. But we find comfort in the thought that perhaps, at this moment, he dazzles the angels and saints in heaven with his brand of wit and humor. I can almost hear him telling the angels and saints, "Let's DOH it."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 25px">To Susan, Jondi, James, Johnet and Joy, you have lost a great husband and an amazing father. I lost a friend, and a dear colleague. And the Filipino nation lost one of its illustrious sons.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 25px">Goodbye Johnny. Rest in eternal peace.</p>
