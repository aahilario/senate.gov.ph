<span class="PRTitle"><!-- NewsTitle.start -->Privilege Speech of Senator Loren Legarda 
- Philippine <br />
Resolution on Wetlands and Disaster Risk Reduction <br />
</span>
</p>
<!-- NewsBody.start -->
<p style="text-align: justify">Mr. President,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Today, we are faced with the great challenge of healing our environment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The disasters that have befallen our nation and the existing risks of potentially destructive natural hazards should be more than enough to change a public mindset intent on extractive and consumptive economics that threatens to destroy what took thousands of years to form.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Humans have altered and degraded ecosystems more rapidly and extensively in the past decades to meet growing demands on basic needs. Although some of these activities have contributed to the well-being of humans as well as to economic development, the ecological consequences are equally significant and alarming.[1]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">In the 24 ecosystem services examined via the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment between 2001-2005, 15 or approximately 60 percent were degraded or used unsustainably, and these changes, some of them irrevocable, would mean that future generations may no longer gain the same benefits from these ecosystems.[2]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Moreover, studies reveal that climate change is "unequivocal," with scientists recently concluding that there is 95 to 100 percent likelihood that human activity is the cause of global warming, mainly due to greenhouse gas, like carbon dioxide emitted through burning of fossil fuel, deforestation and land-use change.[3]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The effects of these activities are greatly felt today as natural hazards of increasing frequency and volume cause the disruption of lives and livelihood and enormous social and economic losses.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The irony is that, the things we want to gain and develop through the use of ecosystem services, are the very same things we lose due to exploitation and unsustainable use of our natural resources.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Mr. President,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The main message that I want to impart is this: We all live in one Earth, and climate change is now teaching us the hard way that we do not own the planet, but are mere dwellers and stewards of its resources. And as such, we must be responsible for and respectful of Mother Nature.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The Biodiversity Management Bureau (BMB) of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) earlier held a consultation-workshop to enhance the draft Philippine Resolution on Wetlands and Disaster Risk Reduction. We are hoping that this will be considered for approval during the 48th meeting of the Standing Committee as part of the proposals at the 12th Meeting of the Conference of the Contracting Parties to the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands (COP 12) in June 2015, in Punta del Este, Uruguay.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">With experts from different stakeholders present in the consultation, we are certain that this is a goal well within our reach, owing to our extensive experience as a nation among those most vulnerable to extreme weather events and climate change.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The greater challenge, however, especially to the experts who know very well the importance of our wetlands to life, livelihood and disaster risk reduction, is how to communicate this message to the people.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">It would not be enough that we have this resolution approved and adopted by the COP 12, because as we bring it up to the policy-makers and decision-makers, we will have to bring it down again to the people who can actually protect our wetlands.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">We are fortunate that the Philippines serves as host to six (6) wetlands of international importance as qualified by the Ramsar Convention, namely the Agusan Marsh Wildlife Sanctuary in Mindanao, Naujan Lake National Park in Oriental Mindoro, Olango Island Wildlife Sanctuary in Cebu, Puerto Princesa Subterranean River National Park in Palawan, the Tubbataha Reefs Natural Park in Sulu Sea, and the Las Pi&ntilde;as-Para&ntilde;aque Critical Habitat and Ecotourism Area (LPPCHEA). [4]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Wetlands, which are either natural or man-made, are permanently or seasonally saturated by water, which make them suitable for vegetation that can adapt to saturated soil conditions. Their basic function is to conserve and provide water. [5]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Wetlands also play a significant role in climate change adaptation and disaster risk mitigation. Apart from supporting biodiversity in their host areas, wetlands also regulate water flow and precipitation, and thus act as flood control system and provide protection against strong waves.[6]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Let me now tell you a story. In the Municipality of General MacArthur, Eastern Samar, residents have their mangroves to thank as these shielded them from the wrath of supertyphoon Yolanda. The town was spared from massive destruction since the mangroves served as buffer against the storm surge. Nearby coastal towns without mangroves suffered a different fate.[7]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Mr. President,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">This is one story that highlights the importance of wetlands such as mangrove forests. However, we must not wait for every community to experience a disaster or escape from one to make them realize the vital role of ecosystems in DRR.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Seagrass beds prevent coastal erosion; coral reefs also provide protection against storm surges and inundation; mountain lakes and marshes reduce peak flooding; while wetlands' ability to retain water longer than other areas make them vital in times of drought.[8]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Wetlands are likewise essential to food and water security and can provide alternative livelihood through ecotourism. Without wetlands, other ecosystems like marine and forest will all suffer.  Species of birds, migratory and non-migratory, will also suffer as well as other flora and fauna.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The biodiversity associated within the country's 216 lakes, 421 principal rivers, and 22 marshes, swamps and reservoirs is critical to food security and livelihood through fisheries and other resources.[9]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Mr. President,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">All these realities and other benefits we can gain through the sustainable use of our wetlands should be understood by citizens, because in addressing the challenges of protecting our wetlands and other ecosystems, we need to put communities at the heart of relevant programs and policies and gather collective action that is rooted in a sense of solidarity and shared responsibility.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Each of us has opportunities to make a difference for our future. We must take hold of the opportunity to responsibly manage our wetlands. We must maintain focus and momentum in order to restore health to our wetlands and other critical ecosystems and thereby protect our citizens from the impacts of natural hazards and climate change.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Thank you.</p>
