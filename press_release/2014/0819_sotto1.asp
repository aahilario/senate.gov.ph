<p style="text-align: justify">Mr. President, colleagues:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">I rise to speak about a plant formally named as cannabis; commonly known as marijuana but carries a variety of street names.  Let us see its true nature, so we can make reasoned judgments in the light of recent developments urging legalization of marijuana use, ostensibly for medical reasons.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Firstly, Mr. President, what is Marijuana?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime defines and describes Marijuana as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">1.	Cannabis is a tobacco-like greenish or brownish material made of the dried flowering tops and leaves of the cannabis (hemp) plant.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">2.	Cannabis resin or "hash" is the dried black or brown secretion of the flowering tops of the cannabis plant, which is made into a powder or pressed into slabs or cakes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">3.	Cannabis oil or "hash oil" is a liquid extracted from either the dried plant material or the resin.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">4.	All forms of cannabis are usually smoked. Cannabis resin and oil can also be swallowed or brewed into tea.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">5.	Cannabis can make users feel pleasurably relaxed and sometimes euphoric. Users may also experience a more vivid sense of sight, smell, taste and hearing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">6.	In the short term, users have an increased appetite and pulse rate. Users also have problems performing physical and intellectual tasks such as driving a car and thinking logically.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">7.	With large doses, users' perceptions of sound and color may be sharpened, while their thinking becomes slow and confused. If the dose is very large, the effects of cannabis are similar to those hallucinogens and may cause anxiety, panic and even psychotic episodes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">8.	Regular users of cannabis risk developing psychological dependence to the point where they lose interest in all other activities, such as work and personal relationships. Recent studies in the United Kingdom show a link between cannabis use and an increase in schizophrenia.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">9.	Cannabis smoke contains 50 per cent more tar than high-tar cigarettes, which puts users at an increased risk of lung cancer and other respiratory diseases.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Thus, Mr. President, studies have shown the following as the ill effects of marijuana use:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p style="text-align: justify">Memory loss,  brain development problems,  depression,  schizophrenia and mental illness 
	</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p style="text-align: justify">Respiratory problems </p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p style="text-align: justify">Distorted perception (sounds, sights, time, touch) 
	</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p style="text-align: justify">Hallucinations and Delusions </p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p style="text-align: justify">Sleeplessness </p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p style="text-align: justify">Bad Temper and tendency towards violence</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify">What is the view of the United Nations and the Philippines on Marijuana? The United Nations considers Marijuana as an illegal narcotic drug and prohibits smoking and ingestion of Marijuana and its component substances and derivatives. The Philippines adheres to this UN position and under our present laws, stiff and long-term imprisonment is imposed on its possession, sale, and usage.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Under Republic Act 9165, also known as the Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002, Marijuana is classified as a dangerous drug, with imprisonment ranging from 12 years to life imprisonment, depending on the quantity.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">More importantly, Mr. President, we are signatory to various United Nations Conventions and International Agreements which classified marijuana as a  dangerous drug, particularly the United Nation's Commission on Narcotic Drugs (UN-CND) Schedule IV.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Every year, there are numerous petitions asking the U.N. that Marijuana be legalized because of its medical benefits. There is no scientific evidence from controlled studies in humans that it can cure anything except perhaps having a placebo effect. That is why the United Nations has consistently refused to give in to their petitions. The United Nations Commission on Narcotic Drugs (UN-CND) has the most powerful research machinery and I do not think that these people who are lobbying for the legalization of marijuana have done a  much better research and presentation than those seeking United Nations approval.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Some decades ago, other climes and cultures, and drug groups encouraged and deceived some states to adopt a new mindset in order to legalize marijuana use. However,  the trend nowadays is on reverse mode, they are now contemplating a retraction of their legalization measures.  They are beset with Marijuana-related problems such as an increase in criminality, drug addiction, and proliferation of undesirable characters in their parks and highways. We can cite  Uruguay. This country has been delaying implementation of the legal framework for marijuana operation. Canada, Switzerland and the Netherlands also belong to this group that are now feeling sorry for their mistake.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">	The Marijuana legalization in Europe did not take too long to reach the shores of the United States through the machinations of the Mexican Drug Cartel. On November 6, 2012, Colorado became the second state to legalize Marijuana possession and use, following the footsteps of California.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Colorado's legalization of Marijuana is contained in their  Amendment 64 which allowed the private use, limited possession and home-growing of marijuana legal under Colorado law for adults 21 years of age and older and established a system in which marijuana is regulated, taxed, and distributed similarly to alcohol. Just two years into their legalization regime of Marijuana use, Colorado had started to think twice about their experiment. They have retained as illegal the driving of motor vehicles while under the influence of Marijuana. This shows how contradictory the position of Marijuana advocates really is.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Drug pushers are definitely behind this worldwide push towards legalization of Marijuana use. Here, we have a watchlist from  PDEA, NBI, AIDSOTF, at ISAFP focusing on such groups behind this move.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">For these groups and those who insist on legalizing marijuana for medical use I share the information coming from the FDA and the DDB. Under Sections 16 and 93 of the present law, RA 9165,   such medical use of marijuana is envisioned:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">		SEC. 16. Cultivation or Culture of Plants Classified as Dangerous drugs or are Sources Thereof. -	</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">		...</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">		"Provided, That in the case of medical laboratories and medical research centers which cultivate or culture marijuana, opium poppy and other plants, or materials of such dangerous drugs for medical experiments and research purposes, or for the creation of new types of medicine, the (DDB) Board shall prescribe the necessary implementing guidelines for the proper cultivation, culture, handling experimentation and disposal of such plants and materials.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">		"SEC. 93. -Reclassification, Addition or Removal of Any Drug from the List of Dangerous Drugs. - The (Dangerous Drugs) Board (DDB) shall have the power to reclassify, add to or remove from the list of dangerous drugs.  Proceedings to reclassify, add, or remove a drug or other substance may be initiated by the PDEA, the DOH, or by petition from any interested party, including the manufacturer of a drug, a medical society or association, a pharmacy association, a public interest group concerned with drug abuse, a national or local government, or an individual citizen.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Dahil ginawa at inumpisahan na sa America, eto naman tayo at di naglaon ay may nagpanukala na ito ay gayahin.  On May 26, 2014, House Bill 4477, entitled "Compassionate Use of Medical Cannabis Act", was filed, stating that Marijuana use has medical properties that certain persons suffering from such diseases as cachexia (ka/kek/siya) or wasting syndrome etc.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Kung gagayahin natin itong ginawa ng dalawang estado sa Estados Unidos, eh di gayahin narin natin ang kanilang panukala na huwag na ring magdasal sa mga paaralan. Pati ang prayer dito sa Senado ay itigil narin at ng tayo'y maging katulad nang ibang bansa. Ganun ba ang gusto nating mangyari, Mr. President? I remember an imaginary conversation I came across recently when a mass murder happened in a school campus in the United States and a mother of one of the victims asked where God was when the massacre was going on. And God, in that imagined conversation supposedly replied: "You took me out of the school campus, remember?"</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">In one article Tina Griego, the Post reporter who wrote the story, joined Bill O'Reilly on tonight's "Factor", stated that there is an illegal marijuana market flourishing beneath the cover of the legal marijuana market in Colorado.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">In conclusion, Mr. President, I dare say that our laws must conform to our culture, knowledge and experiences. Other countries and cultures may have their ways different from ours.  Iba batas sa Middle East, iba sa China, iba sa Europe. Try walking with a woman not your wife in one place, or sell drugs in China, or be holpelessly old and sick in some countries in Europe, delikado ang buhay mo. Tanggap natin ito, because crimes are defined by the state we are in at a particular time.  Respetohan lang ng kanya-kanyang batas.  If we must progress in our laws, let it be attuned to our own concepts and culture.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The answer is in our hands. The future of our youth must be better than today. We have to say NO to Marijuana legalization, whether for medical or recreational use. Yung mga gumagamit nito ngayon, huwag nyo nang idamay ang mga batang walang kamalay-malay.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">	Thank you.</p>
