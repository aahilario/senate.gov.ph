Press Release<br /><!-- NewsDate.start -->May 15, 2006<!-- NewsDate.end --><p style="text-align: left"><!-- NewsTitle.start -->Transcript of Senate President Franklin 
M. Drilon's Press Conference<!-- NewsBody.start --><p align="justify"><i>On the term-sharing agreement</i></p>

<p align="justify">SPFMD: I will certainly honor my gentleman's agreement with Senator Manuel 
Villar. As we have announced in our joint statement in July of 2004, I will 
support Senator Villar's bid for the Senate presidency when the 3rd regular 
session of the Senate of the 13th Congress begins in July of this year. Under 
our rules and as shown by tradition --- as in all leadership changes in the 
Philippine Senate, the incoming Senate President will have to carry the mandate 
and support of 13 senators expressed through a signed resolution. I will sign 
that resolution.</p>

<p align="justify"><i>On the statement of Sen. Miriam</i></p>

<p align="justify">SPFMD: There is a statement by Sen. Miriam Defensor that there will no longer 
be a Senate in July. My comment: from what I understood from Sen. 
Defensor-Santiago's statement, she expects the Supreme Court to rule on the 
legality of the House of Representatives being able to do the constituent 
assembly on its own to propose amendments to the 1987 Constitution in total 
disregard of the Senate. Sen. Miriam Defensor Santiago expects a ruling by the 
Supreme Court by July of 2006 that the proposal that the House of 
Representatives can simply fulfill the requirements of 195 votes will be 
sufficient to constitute a constituent assembly even without the participation 
of the Senate. On March 21, 2006, no less than 22 senators expressed the 
position that the Senate and the House must vote separately in a constituent 
assembly before any amendment or revision of the Constitution can be introduced. 
This proposed Senate resolution No. 473 was signed by all senators, 22, except 
for Senator Jun Magsaysay who is on sick leave. This resolution was adopted 
unanimously by the Senate without any objection on March 21 and is now Senate 
Resolution No. 75. We intend to rely on the authority of the entire Senate 
through this resolution unanimously adopted, in bringing the resolution before 
the Supreme Court if the matter is brought by the House of Representatives to 
the Comelec as the process would be, through a request that a plebiscite be 
conducted. We intend to oppose that resolution in the Comelec on a proposal to 
conduct a plebiscite should it be brought before the Comelec and whatever 
decision of the Comelec will certainly reach the Supreme Court. I am confident 
that the position of the Senate will be sustained by the Supreme Court, we have 
strong legal arguments and that I do not believe that the issue can be resolved 
by July.</p>

<p align="justify">There is also a news report that 3 of my colleagues will join the 
House-initiated constituent assembly. Convening both houses of Congress, the 
Senate and the House of Representatives, into a constituent assembly requires 
the passage of a concurrent resolution to be passed by both houses of Congress. 
In fact, the House has passed a concurrent resolution which called for the 
constitution of a constituent assembly by both the Senate and the House. What 
happened to this resolution, I think it was passed December of last year. If I'm 
not mistaken, this was referred by the House to the Senate for our concurrence 
and we referred it after first reading to the Committee on Constitutional 
Amendments, Revisions of Codes and Laws where it is now pending. This referral 
of the House clearly indicates that the House recognizes that the Senate must 
concur in a resolution constituting Congress into a constituent assembly before 
we can validly convene a constituent assembly. In fact, this issue of the 
constituent assembly, I understand, would be in the agenda of tomorrow's LEDAC 
meeting which I will attend. We intend to present the Senate resolution before 
the LEDAC. This is a Senate resolution which I will execute as Senate President 
and will be the basis of any future action by the Senate insofar as these issues 
are concerned.</p>

<p align="justify"><i>Q: Do you think the Supreme Court can't act on the House resolution if the 
Senate has not..</i></p>

<p align="justify">SPFMD: The Supreme Court will only act on a case filed before it. The process 
is that the Supreme Court will review the decision of the Comelec that will 
conduct the plebiscite. By way of background, what is the process? The process 
is assuming that the House will insist that they can do it alone. What the House 
will now do after having presumably the signatures, they will now ask the 
Comelec to conduct a plebiscite in order to ratify the proposed revisions to the 
Constitution which they will propose. It is in the Comelec that the legal battle 
will start because in the Comelec, we will take the position that there can be 
no valid plebiscite because there was no valid constituent assembly. It is now 
the resolution of the Comelec that we brought up to the Supreme Court.</p>

<p align="justify"><i>Q: They will convene first into a constituent assembly before asking for 
the plebiscite?</i></p>

<p align="justify">SPFMD: They can convene as a constituent assembly. That is to us, an exercise 
in futility from a legal standpoint.</p>

<p align="justify"><i>Q: Hindi pa pwede immediately iakyat sa Supreme Court..?</i></p>

<p align="justify">SPFMD: There are two schools of thought on this: you can go up to the Supreme 
Court immediately or you have to wait for the Comelec. There is the doctrine of 
exhaustion of administrative remedies, meaning, that the Supreme Court in a 
number of cases in the past has ruled that where the remedy is available in the 
proceedings other that the Supreme Court, that proceeding must first be 
exhausted. That principle could be applied in this case.</p>

<p align="justify"><i>Q: The Senate will present its position as an institution?</i></p>

<p align="justify">SPFMD: That is correct because the Senate has already passed a resolution 
unanimously approved on March 21.</p>

<p align="justify"><i>Q: Were you able to confirm Sen. Santiago's statements on Sen. Lapid and 
Sen. Angara?</i></p>

<p align="justify">SPFMD: I have not confirmed but even assuming that that is the case, Sen. 
Angara and Sen. Lapid assuming that they will attend, they will be attending in 
their personal capacity and cannot carry the institution of the Senate because 
the Senate as an institution has passed a resolution expressing the position 
that voting must be done separately. Sens. Angara and Lapid were among the 
signatories.</p>

<p align="justify"><i>Q: Do you find it extraordinary that a senator would call for the 
abolition of the same institution where she is a part of?</i></p>

<p align="justify">SPFMD: I would not comment on that. Each senator is entitled to his or her 
opinion.</p>

<p align="justify"><i>Q: Are you coming to LEDAC tomorrow?</i></p>

<p align="justify">SPFMD: We will be having a caucus this afternoon; I called for a caucus. We 
will be discussing the priority measures; on top of this will be the budget 
which was delayed in the House for about 9 months and referred to us as we went 
on our Lenten break. I have discussed the issue on the passage of the budget 
with the Chairman of our Finance Committee, Sen. Villar, the Minority Leader, 
Sen. Pimentel and Sen. Kiko Pangilinan and we have agreed that we will present 
to the senators in our caucus this afternoon the need for us to pass the budget 
before we adjourn. We will also discuss what other legislative measures we can 
squeeze into this tight schedule and we'll present the same tomorrow at the 
LEDAC.</p>

<p align="justify"><i>Q: Will you confirm to individual senators if they maintain their stand on 
Con-Ass?</i></p>

<p align="justify">SPFMD: This Con-Ass resolution was adopted by the Senate. It is not only a 
resolution of the individual senators but of the Senate as an institution. 
Therefore, any changes in their position must be through a Senate action.</p>

<p align="justify"><i>Q: They cannot just withdraw their signature?</i></p>

<p align="justify">SPFMD: The resolution is already approved by the Senate. This is Senate 
Resolution No. 75. This is the resolution expressing the sense of the Senate 
that any proposed amendment to or revision of the Constitution requires the 
approval of the Senate and the House of Representatives voting separately. This 
was adopted by the Senate on March 21.</p>

<p align="justify"><i>Q: They cannot somersault?</i></p>

<p align="justify">SPFMD: That is their own decision but the Senate as an institution has taken 
this position. For this resolution to be set aside must require the majority 
vote of the Senate.</p>

<p align="justify"><i>Q: The Senate is against Con-Ass itself or only against the 'voting as 
one?'</i></p>

<p align="justify">SPFMD: The resolution says, &quot;to express the sense of the Senate that any 
proposed amendment to or revision of the Constitution requires the approval of 
the Senate and the House of Representatives, voting separately.&quot;</p>

<p align="justify"><i>Q: Kung voting separately, would the Senate agree to a Con-Ass?</i></p>

<p align="justify">SPFMD: That is a matter before the committee of Sen. Dick Gordon. A 
resolution of that nature must be presented as a committee report by Sen. Dick 
Gordon as chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Amendments, Revision of 
Codes and Laws.</p>

<p align="justify"><i>Q: The resolution referred to the Committee of Gordon</i></p>

<p align="justify">SPFMD: That is the resolution of the House constituting both houses of 
Congress into a Constituent Assembly, which is now pending in the committee of 
Sen. Gordon.</p>

<p align="justify"><i>Q: Would the leadership sanction senators who would change positions?</i></p>

<p align="justify">SPFMD: No, there is no such thing.</p>

<p align="justify"><i>Q: Are you going to convince your colleagues in the Liberal Party to 
support Villar?</i></p>

<p align="justify">SPFMD: There is no party position on this. I signed the agreement not as 
party president. I was not even party president at that point. It is a personal 
matter between me and Senator Villar.</p>

<p align="justify"><i>Q: Will you campaign for Senator Villar?</i></p>

<p align="justify">SPFMD: I already made a statement. I said I will support the bid of Senator 
Villar.</p>

<p align="justify"><i>Q: Would you also convince those who voted for you to vote for Senator 
Villar?</i></p>

<p align="justify">SPFMD: I have already made a statement on this. I said I will support the bid 
of Senator Villar for the Senate presidency.</p>

<p align="justify"><i>Q: Do you plan to discuss that in the caucus?</i></p>

<p align="justify">SPFMD: No, there is no plan. I already made a commitment.</p>

<p align="justify"><i>Q: How does the process work?</i></p>

<p align="justify">SPFMD: As I have already stated, under our Rules, and by tradition of the 
Senate, in any change in the leadership of the Senate, the incoming Senate 
President carries with him the support of 13 senators through a signed 
resolution. I will sign that resolution.</p>

<p align="justify"><i>Q: Villar still needs 11?</i></p>

<p align="justify">SPFMD: Yes.</p>

<p align="justify"><i>Q: On the budget</i></p>

<p align="justify">SPFMD: Senator Villar and I will propose to the Senate caucus this afternoon 
that the report of the finance committee on the budget will be presented on the 
floor on May 22.</p>

<p align="justify"><i>Q: What other measures will you act on?</i></p>

<p align="justify">SPFMD: We will also exert every effort to pass the measure on electoral 
reform, which Senator Gordon is working on. There is also the measure which 
proposes to establish the Credit Bureau, which is in the final stages of 
interpellation.</p>

<p align="justify"><i>Q: Sa LEDAC agenda iyung Constituent Assembly</i></p>

<p align="justify">SPFMD: That is a proposed agenda in the LEDAC. I received a notice saying 
under Roman Numeral II, proposals for the convening of a Constituent Assembly to 
be presented by Constantino Jaraula.</p>

<p align="justify"><i>Q: Is the majority in favor of Con-Ass.</i></p>

<p align="justify">SPFMD: I have not discussed that with them. (end)</p>
