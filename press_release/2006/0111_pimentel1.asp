			<span class="PRTitle"><!-- NewsTitle.start -->NO NEED FOR COMPROMISE DEAL ON COCONUT LEVY CASE -- PIMENTEL<!-- NewsTitle.end --></span></p>
<!-- NewsBody.start -->
			<p style="text-align: left;">
			Senate Minority Leader Aquilino Q. Pimentel, Jr. (PDP-Laban) today 
			branded as a backward and illogical step the move of the 
			Presidential Commission on Good Government to revive the negotiation 
			between coconut farmers and businessman Eduardo Danding Cojuangco, 
			Jr. for a compromise agreement on the 18-year old coconut levy case.<br /><br />Pimentel pointed out that the Sandiganbayan, in a decision issued in 
			May, 2004, held that the 27 percent shareholding in the San Miguel 
			Corporation (SMC), originally acquired through the coconut levy 
			funds, was owned by coconut farmers, held in trust by the government 
			for the benefit of the farmers and the coconut industry.<br /><br />He said the Sandiganbayan issued the decision after it was ordered 
			by the Supreme Court to resolve the issue. Subsequently, he said 
			there was a motion filed with the anti-graft court to execute the 
			decision.<br /><br />However, he said the motion to execute has not yet been acted upon 
			by the Sandiganbayan.<br /><br />There is no need for a compromise agreement on the disputed coconut 
			levy assets. Normally you enter into a compromise agreement before 
			or during the middle of the litigation, but not when a decision has 
			already been rendered by the court, Pimentel said.<br /><br />He said he could not find any rhyme nor reason behind the stand of 
			the PCGG, as spelled out by Chairman Camilo Sabio, to seek an 
			out-of-court-settlement between the coconut farmers and Cojuangco on 
			the coconut levy case at this stage.<br /><br />He said the PCGGs action reflects the Arroyo governments lack of 
			direction and resolve in settling the case and its indifference to 
			the plight of about 8 million, small coconut farmers and their 
			families whose economic condition continues to deteriorate due to 
			the governments failure to rehabilitate the ailing coconut industry 
			and rescue it from the brink of collapse.<br /><br />According to Pimentel, the Sandiganbayan ruling on the ownership of 
			the 27 percent shareholding in the SMC applied to six coconut oil 
			mills and 14 companies.<br /><br />The minority leader warned that a compromise agreement at this time 
			would only push back the governments prolonged efforts to recover 
			the coconut levy assets. He said this would also render meaningless 
			the hard-earned legal victory of the government and the PCGG during 
			the chairmanship of Haydee Yorac on the issue of ownership and 
			control of the 27 percent SMC shareholding.<br /><br />The 27 percent is entirely different from the 20 percent 
			shareholding in the SMC which Cojuangco is claiming to have been 
			acquired through his personal funds and which the government is also 
			claiming.<br /><br />Pimentel said the more the PCGGs move for a compromise settlement 
			becomes ridiculous in the light of Cojuangcos public statement 
			opposing it and maintaining that he would rather see the case 
			resolved by the courts.<br /><br />Criticizing the Arroyo government for its confusing policy in 
			resolving the coconut levy controversy, Pimentel recalled that it 
			ruled out any out-of-court settlement on the case during the early 
			part of its term and instead followed Yoracs position to rely on 
			the courts to resolve the case.<br /><br />Moreover, Pimentel recalled that the Arroyo government, upon its 
			inception in 2001, revoked an already-completed compromise agreement 
			between the farmers and Mr. Cojuangco on the coconut levy dispute. 
			The compromise agreement was negotiated by the government of 
			President Joseph Estrada with the help of Catholic bishops and 
			business leaders.<br /><br />He said that had the November, 2000 compromise agreement not been 
			shelved by the Arroyo government, it would haven unfrozen billions 
			of pesos funds needed for the massive replanting of high-yielding 
			coconut varieties and for alternative livelihood projects for 
			marginalized farmers.<br /><br />Under the compromise agreement, P50 billion from the proceeds of the 
			sale of the 27 percent of SMC shareholding would be set aside for 
			the establishment of a coconut industry trust fund to be 
			administered by coconut farmers themselves.<br /><br />In my view, the Arroyo governments decision to revoke that 
			compromise agreement was a colossal mistake because it shut off the 
			release of much-needed funds to alleviate the plight of the 
			long-suffering coconut farmers, Pimentel said.<br /><br />Pimentel said it is dismaying that five years after invalidating the 
			already-completed compromise agreement on the coconut levy case, the 
			Arroyo government will go through the rigmarole of striking a 
			similar agreement as if to admit that its earlier action was a 
			mistake.</p><!-- NewsBody.end --></td>
