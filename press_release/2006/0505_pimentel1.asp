<span class="PRTitle"><!-- NewsTitle.start -->GLOBAL WARMING DESTROYING THE ENVIRONMENT 
<br />AT AN ALARMING PACE -- PIMENTEL<!-- NewsTitle.end --></span></p>
<!-- NewsBody.start --><p>Senate Minority Leader Aquilino Nene Q. Pimentel, 
Jr. (PDP-Laban) today called on the international community to take concerted, 
tougher steps to prevent global warming which has been destroying the 
environment at an alarming pace and making life in the planet earth more 
difficult.</p>
<p>Pimentel said the heavy flooding in Balkan countries last month, the abnormal 
rise in sea levels in various parts of the globe, the rapid melting of snow in 
Greenland and the Antarctic, and the killer floods and landslides in Southern 
Leyte last February could all be traced to global warming caused by the unabated 
deforestation and burning of fossil fuels that releases greenhouses gases into 
the global atmosphere.</p>
<p>Speaking at the conference on Climate Change and its Impact on Economic 
Development in Helsinki, Finland, Pimentel cited the graphic warning of Canadian 
Minister of Environment David Anderson that global warming poses more danger to 
the security of the world than terrorism.</p>
<p>Unless checked, global warming would bring greater havoc to mankind than 
terrorist acts. It would devastate the ecological balance of the world and 
potentially eliminate all life-forms as we know them, he said.</p>
<p>In the Middle East, Pimentel said the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is now 
experiencing rainfall, which was considered strange by a Filipino worker who has 
worked there for the last 11 years.</p>
<p>He said a lady from Scotland told him some months ago that a ski resort in 
her hometown Aberdeen has now closed shop because there is not enough snow.</p>
<p>Pimentel said that during a visit to Tibet last month, a tourist guide told 
him that she found the climate in her city, Lhasa, a little warmer than was 
usual in the last several years.</p>
<p>In Sri Lanka, he said a Filipino woman told him that when she first arrived 
there five years ago, one half of the island-country had basically a wet season; 
the other half had a dry one. But now, she said the wet side experiences very 
little rain and the arid one gets unusually heavy rains.</p>
<p>In North Korea, Pimentel said Choe Thae Bok, chair of the Supreme Peoples 
Assembly told a group of Filipino legislators last week that some 25 centimeters 
of snow fell in early April in Kangmonsan  something that had not happened 
before. Also sand storms, the first in 10 years or so, hit that province in the 
last couple of weeks.</p>
<p>The accounts of climatic changes in Saudi Arabia, Scotland, Sri Lanka, Tibet 
and North Korea may be anecdotal. The fact, however, is that simple scientific 
warnings about the dangers of global warming have been credibly aired in the 
Kyoto convention in 1997 and in Montreal in 2005 and in a number of other 
regional environmental conferences. And now the perils stare us in the face, 
the senator from Mindanao told the conference.</p>
<p>Pimentel also cited a report of Time Magazine (April 2, 2006) that global 
warming is annihilating wildlife even in the United States, Australia and other 
parts of the globe. He said it is devastating traditional farms and peoples 
homes and is poisoning water sources specially those near the seashores.</p>
<p>He said the 2,000 leading scientists who prepared the United Nations 
Intergovernmental Panel Report on Climate Change have also predicted that by 
2100, Earths average temperature will climb between 1.5 and 6 degrees Celsius, 
rising twice as fast in the Arctic.</p>
<p>Satellites and tide gauges used by the scientists show that seas rose about 
eight inches over the last century and the pace has picked up markedly since the 
1990s.</p>
<p>Pimentel said that Andres S. Revkin wrote in the New York Times of March 24, 
quoting recent findings of several teams of scientists, that by 2100 the oceans 
could rise 13 to 20 feet  conditions last seen 129,000 years ago, between the 
last two ice ages.</p>
<p>Now, even as we are still 94 years away from the year 2100, scientists 
report that ice sheets and glaciers in Greenland add in the Antarctic are 
melting at a rate much faster than usual, he said.</p>
<p>As a result, the Czech Republic and Poland experienced flooding on April 1, 
2006. Flood waters also inundated certain Balkan countries; Romania, Bulgaria 
and Serbia in mid-April. The case was the same  rapidly meting snow.</p>
<p>Pimentel said that is probably why 0.05 percent of Uruguays land mass and 80 
percent of Majuro Atolls (in the Marshall Islands) were swallowed up by the 
rising sea.</p>
<p>He said the scientists cited by Revkin have categorically concluded that: 
most of the warming observed over the last 50 years is attributable to human 
activities.</p>
<p>And they have identified the burning of fossil fuel as a major culprit in 
global warming that releases greenhouse gases with smog-causing pollutants into 
global atmosphere at a rate faster than the Earth can absorb, Pimentel said.</p>
<p>Happily, he said some 141 countries, including the Philippines, have already 
signed the Kyoto Protocol to reduce global greenhouse emissions.</p>
<p>Pimentel proposed the establishment of a network of parliamentarians and 
non-government organizations focused particularly on the issue of global 
warming.</p>
<p>If we get that network organized, then, we can bring the issue with more 
immediacy to the attention of our respective peoples and for effective action by 
our governments, he said.</p>
<p>Pimentel also suggested that members of the Asia-Europe Parliamentary 
Partnership (ASEP) should prod their governments to take the concerted step to 
curb carbon dioxide and other toxic emission in their respective countries since 
our lives and the lives of our children are at stake.</p>
