Press Release<br /><!-- NewsDate.start -->March 17, 2006<!-- NewsDate.end --><p style="text-align: center">
<span class="PRTitle"><!-- NewsTitle.start -->Drilon says Atienza, Defensor, et al. 
deemed resigned from Liberal Party<!-- NewsTitle.end --></span></p>
<!-- NewsBody.start --><p align="justify">Senate President and Liberal Party 
head Franklin Drilon today announced the ouster of Manila Mayor Lito Atienza, 
former party chairman, and four other top LP officials from the party roll of 
members after they were &quot;deemed resigned from the party&quot; for holding a rump 
convention and election of officers at the Manila Hotel last March 2.</p>
<p align="justify">In a press conference during the Cavite LP Chapter Solidarity 
Rally held at the General Trias Convention Center Friday afternoon, Drilon said 
a resolution passed by the LP National Political Council had declared Atienza, 
Presidential Chief of Staff Mike Defensor, Antique Gov. Sally Perez, Northern 
Samar Rep. Harlin Cast-Abayon and Batangas Gov. Armand Sanchez &quot;deemed resigned 
from the Liberal Party for convening and holding the unauthorized assembly of LP 
leaders and the election of renegade officers on 2 March 2006 at the Manila 
Hotel.&quot;</p>
<p align="justify">Senate Majority Leader Kiko Pangilinan replaced Atienza as LP 
national chairman while Capiz Gov. Vic Bermejo replaced Perez as Vice President 
for the Visayas, Drilon said. Defensor, Abayon and Sanchez do not hold officers 
positions in the party.</p>
<p align="justify">&quot;This is the best thing that ever happened to the Liberal 
Party,&quot; Drilon said. &quot;Now, the entire Filipino nation can tell who among us 
joined the Liberal Party for political convenience and who joined for principles 
and conviction.&quot;</p>
<p align="justify">At the same time, Drilon lashed at President Gloria Macapagal 
Arroyo and her allies for attempting to steal the Liberal Party. &quot;President 
Arroyo, who has yet to answer charges that she stole the last elections, is now 
trying to steal the Liberal Party,&quot; Drilon said.</p>
<p align="justify">&quot;But more than just a name, the Liberal Party is a principled 
spirit that stands firmly against tyranny or when our democracy is threatened. 
Even if they try to steal our name, Atienza and the Malaca&ntilde;ang
 puppets can never 
be considered true liberals,&quot; Drilon said, referring to Arroyos allies who 
tried to unseat him as party president. &quot;Mice who try to project themselves as 
lions will eventually fail because they do not have the heart and cannot roar.&quot;</p>
<p align="justify">Drilon said Atienza and his group will never be accepted by 
the Filipinos as true liberals. &quot;They are the extensions of a president who has 
illusions of legitimacy. They are weaving the illusion that they are the 
historic liberal party,&quot; he said. &quot;Ninoy Aquino embodied the liberal spirit that 
fights tyranny. Atienza and his ilk can never be like Ninoy Aquino. Ninoy kicked 
the tryrants ass. They are there to lick it.&quot;</p>
<p align="justify">During the press conference, Drilon also announced minor 
changes in the LP list of officers. Tarlac Rep. Benigno &quot;Noynoy&quot; Aquino III was 
elected the new LP Vice Chairman, taking the position vacated by Pangilinan. 
Sen. Mar Roxas was voted as LP Executive Vice President while Former Education 
Secretary Butch Abad was elevated to the post of Vice President for Platforms, 
Policies and Advocacies. Bukidnon Rep. Neric Acosta, erstwhile Executive VP, 
will now serve as Secretary General vice Aquino.</p>
<p align="justify">In a resolution signed by members of the LP National 
Political Council, Atienza, Defensor, Abayon, Perez and Sanchez were also 
declared &quot;guilty of culpable violations of the LP Constitution by committing 
acts antagonistic and inimical to the party objectives and interest; dishonesty 
and abuse of authority by maliciously and deliberately planning and conspiring 
and organizing the rump session to unset the duly elected party officers.&quot;</p>
<p align="justify">By such overt acts, the resolution said, Atienza, Defensor, 
Abayon, Perez and Sanchez &quot;have considered themselves deemed resigned from the 
party.&quot;</p>
<p align="justify">Drilon said other LP officials who participated in the rump 
convention organized by Atienza were undergoing further investigation to 
determine the extent of their participation in the illegal activity. &quot;Its a 
continuing process,&quot; Drilon said. Among those who supported the move to oust 
Atienza and company from the party were three past LP presidents namely Abad, 
Northern Samar Gov. Raul Daza, former senator Wigberto Tanada.</p>
<p align="justify">LP Director General Chit Asis said Drilon has been getting 
overwhelming expressions of support from LP chapters in the provinces as well as 
from the partys allied organizations.</p>
<p align="justify">&quot;We have been getting _expression of support from the LP 
chapters in Northern Luzon, Southen Luzon, Davao, the Caraga Region, Lanao del 
Norte, Iloilo City, Guimaras, and many more,&quot; Asis said.</p>
<p align="justify">He added that majority of the LP members in local government 
units such as Isabela Gov. Grace Padaca, Cavite Gov. Ayong Maliksi, Iliolo Gov. 
Neil Tupaz, Capiz Gov. Vic Bermejo, Naga Mayor Jess Robredo and many others 
expressed their support for the leadership of Drilon.</p>
<p align="justify">Drilon also warned that Atienzas group was planning to hold 
another &quot;rump meeting of the LP National Executive Council or the National 
Political Council&quot; next week in an apparent effort &quot;to legitimize the illegal 
Manila Hotel elections.&quot;</p>
<p align="justify">&quot;Certainly, you cannot legitimize an illegal activity with 
another illegal activity,&quot; Drilon said.</p>
<p align="justify">Under the LP Constitution and By-Laws, Drilon pointed out, 
only the party president can convene a meeting of either the National Executive 
Council or the National Political Council. Besides, he added, Atienzas group 
composed only a small minority of both councils.</p>
