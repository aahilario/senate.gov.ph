Press Release<br /><!-- NewsDate.start -->May 25, 2006<!-- NewsDate.end --><p style="text-align: center">
<span class="PRTitle"><!-- NewsTitle.start -->IPU COMMITTEE ON HUMAN RIGHTS WILL KEEP 
<br />FOLLOWING UP BELTRAN CASE<!-- NewsTitle.end --></span></p>
<!-- NewsBody.start --><p>The International Parliamentary Union (IPU), through 
its Committee on Human Rights, will continue to follow up the case of Anak-Pawis 
party-list Rep. Crispin Beltran whose immediate release from police detention it 
has sought from the Philippine government.</p>
<p>This was reported by Senate Minority Leader Aquilino Q. Pimentel, Jr. 
(PDP-Laban) who took up the case of Beltran and five other party-list 
representatives who are facing rebellion and sedition charges during the 114th 
IPU conference in Nairobi, Kenya from May 7-14.</p>
<p>Acting on the recommendation of the Committee on Human Rights, the IPU, 
during the plenary session on May 12, approved a resolution in which it 
expressed deep concern over the arrest and detention of Beltran and urged the 
Philippine authorities to release him particularly in view of the state of his 
health and the fact that a Makati Regional Trial Court ordered his release in 
March 2006.</p>
<p>The IPU noted that Mr. Beltran was arrested on the basis of a legally invalid 
arrest warrant. It said only later in the day of his arrest were inciting to 
sedition charges brought against him, and that only two and eight days, 
respectively after his arrest were two charges of rebellion brought against him.</p>
<p>The sequence of events suggests that there is little evidence against him, 
the IPU said.</p>
<p>The organization further pointed out that no arrest warrants have reportedly 
been issued against Beltran as it questioned what was the legal basis for his 
continued detention.</p>
<p>According to the IPU, the principle of presumption of innocence must be 
respected, which implies that pre-trial detention should be the exception and as 
short as possible.</p>
<p>The IPU requested its secretary general to convey this resolution to the 
parliamentary and other competent authorities, inviting them to provide the 
requested information. It also asked the Committee on Human Rights to continue 
examining this case and report to the IPU at its next session to be held during 
the 115th IPU Assembly (in October, 2006).</p>
<p>In a written report to the Senate, Pimentel said he explained before the IPU 
Committee on Human Rights that Mr. Beltran was invited by law enforcement 
agents for questioning in connection with a rebellion case that was filed 
against him in 1985 during the Marcos authoritarian regime.</p>
<p>He said when President Ferdinand Marcos was deposed in 1986, Beltran was 
among the people amnestied by the Aquino administration. Thus, he said, there 
was no basis for holding Beltran liable for the so-called 1985 rebellion case.</p>
<p>Still, Beltran, who is now 73 years old and in bad health, is restrained of 
his liberty as he is still being detained in a police hospital amid reports that 
he was being charged with new cases of rebellion or sedition, Pimentel informed 
the IPU panel.</p>
<p>The whole case smacks of harassment because Beltran has not been afforded 
his right to be presumed innocent to confront the witnesses against him, to 
evaluate the evidence against him and to be granted bail if the evidence was not 
strong. Those rights are guaranteed in our Constitution and it appears that the 
administration has no compunction about ignoring those rights. By doing so, the 
administration is standing the Rule of Law on its head, Pimentel said.</p>
