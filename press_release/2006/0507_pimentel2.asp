<span class="PRTitle"><!-- NewsTitle.start -->OMBUDSMAN ADVISED TO ABIDE BY SUPREME 
COURT DIRECTIVE TO 
<br />DECIDE ON GRAFT CHARGES VS. POLL EXECS<!-- NewsTitle.end --></span></p>
<!-- NewsBody.start --><p>Senate Minority Leader Aquilino Nene Q. Pimentel, 
Jr. (PDP-Laban) today called on Ombudsman Merceditas Gutierrez to heed the 
directive of the Supreme Court to decide on the graft charges against the 
commissioners and other officials of the Commission on Elections who approved or 
facilitated the P1.3 billion computerization contract with MegaPacific 
consortium which was voided by the Supreme Court for legal and technical flaws 
and for being grossly disadvantageous to the government.</p>
<p>Pimentel hailed the high tribunals order giving the Ombudsman until June 30 
to decide whether there are sufficient grounds to prosecute the respondents and 
file the appropriate charges before the Sandiganbayan.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman should act with dispatch on the graft case against the Comelec 
executives so that justice is done and new commissioners are appointed with 
ample time to familiarize themselves with the laws and procedures for 2007 
elections, he said.</p>
<p>Saying that the Ombudsmans final action on the case is long overdue, 
Pimentel said that as early as October, 2004, the Ombudsmans Legal, Monitoring 
and Prosecution Division had found prima facie evidence to charge the respondent 
Comelec commissioners, and other senior officials, as well as private parties, 
involved in the automation project for violation of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt 
Practices Act (Republic Act 3019).</p>
<p>He said he had been reliably informed that then Ombudsman Simeon Marcelo had 
promised to sign the resolution on the graft case against the respondents in the 
poll automation deal before his resignation Nov. 30, 2005. Unfortunately, he 
said Marcelo reneged on his promise.</p>
<p>Pimentel said the resolution of the graft case is an indispensable part of 
the process for cleansing the Comelec of its tainted image as a scandal-ridden 
institution owing to the allegations of massive fraud that marred the 2004 
presidential election.</p>
<p>He said this will also pave the way for an honest-to-goodness revamp of the 
poll body which is being demanded by majority of the Filipino citizenry in the 
hope of seeing its credibility and integrity restored.</p>
<p>Unless the case is resolved, the stigma of graft will continue to hang over 
the Comelec that will render it ineffective in performing its constitutional 
duties and in safeguarding the integrity of the electoral process, the lone 
senator from Mindanao said.</p>
<p>Pimentel cited a recommendation of Presidential Adviser on Electoral Reforms, 
retired Chief Justice Hilario Davide, Jr. that while Comelec commissioners 
cannot be removed or compelled to resign because they have a fixed term of 
office as constitutional officials, the graft charges against them should be 
expeditiously resolved by the Ombudsman.</p>
<p>In fact, the minority leader said the Ombudsman, if she decides based on 
evidence on hand, can proceed with the criminal prosecution of the four of the 
seven Comelec commissioners who signed the resolution on the automation project 
since they have already retired from the service, and therefore no longer enjoy 
immunity from suit.</p>
<p>In January, 2004, the Supreme Court declared the Comelec-MegaPacific contract 
null and void and ordered the Ombudsman to determine the criminal liability, if 
any, of the public officials, and conspiring private individuals, involved in 
the business deal. The high court also directed the Office of the Solicitor 
General to recover the money paid to MegaPacific.</p>
<p>Pimentel said Ombudsman Gutierrez should give priority to the major, 
high-profile graft cases long pending with her office, specially those involving 
top government officials, instead of dissipating the energies and resources of 
her office to peripheral activities like monitoring of unauthorized use of 
government vehicles for non-official or personal purposes, which is already 
being done by the Office of the Executive Secretary and transportation 
authorities.</p>
<p>He said the Ombudsmans footdragging on the case is unjustified and could not 
be tolerated anymore since it is the mandate of the Ombudsman and her deputies 
as protectors of the people, to act promptly on complaints filed in any form or 
manner against public officials.</p>
<p>Ombudsman investigators, according to Pimentel, have confirmed the 
allegations of the complainants that the 1,961 automated vote-counting machines 
bought from South Korea were grossly overpriced. Citing the report of the 
Ombudsmans Legal, Monitoring and Prosecution Division, he said the Comelec 
officials were also found to have deviated from the agencys own bidding rules 
and specifications for the automated counting machines. The findings also showed 
that the amount for import duties on the counting machines was not deducted from 
the purchase price despite the tax exemption enjoyed by Comelec.</p>
<p>Pimentel said the Comelec officials concerned tried to extricate themselves 
from trouble by trying to convince the Supreme Court to allow the use of the 
counting machines in electoral exercises instead of seeing them lying idle. But 
the high court repeatedly shot down the dubious proposition.</p>
