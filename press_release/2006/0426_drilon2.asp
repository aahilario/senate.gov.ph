Press Release<br /><!-- NewsDate.start -->April 26, 2006<!-- NewsDate.end --><p style="text-align: left">
<span class="PRTitle"><!-- NewsTitle.start -->Transcript of Press Conference of Senate 
President Franklin M. Drilon<!-- NewsTitle.end --></span></p>
<!-- NewsBody.start --><p><i>Q: On the Supreme Court ruling on EO 464 and the 
CPR</i></p>

<p>SPFMD: The Supreme Court has reminded Malaca&ntilde;ang
 that we are a government of 
laws and not of men; that their actions will always be tested against the 
Constitutional boundaries and therefore any excesses will be struck down. This 
was evident in striking down EO 464 and in the CPR policy where the Supreme 
Court very clearly struck down excessive abuse of executive power. The Supreme 
Court should be congratulated for upholding our Constitution.</p>

<p><i>Q: Any prediction on Proclamation 1017?</i></p>

<p>SPFMD: I am confident that given the way 1017 was implemented, particularly 
on the warrantless arrests, the unlawful occupation and raid on certain media 
outlets, the Supreme Court will decide in favor of upholding once more the 
rights guaranteed under our Constitution. General Order No. 5 has no basis in 
law and therefore will be struck down as an undue interference of our freedom of 
speech and of the press.</p>

<p><i>Q: With the decision on CPR, ibig bang sabihin lumakas na yung kaso nung 
group nina Guingona na mag-file ng case against the police?</i></p>

<p>SPFMD: The use of excessive force certainly provides a course of action for 
Vice President Guingona and his group. The use of water cannons is totally 
uncalled for especially considering that this was a peaceful rally conducted by 
personalities who are known to be law-abiding.</p>

<p><i>Q: Palace is suggesting that Congress will make excesses of its own given 
the SC decisions?</i></p>

<p>SPFMD: We are not responsible to Malaca&ntilde;ang
, we are responsible to the 
people. The senators are mature enough to know the bounds of the law. Unlike 
Malaca&ntilde;ang
 which simply disregards the bounds of the Constitution and our laws.</p>

<p><i>Q: Ano ang masasabi ninyo sa magkakasunod na desisyon ng Korte Suprema?</i></p>

<p>SPFMD: Nagkataon lamang na ang mga polisiya na pinaiiral ng Malaca&ntilde;ang
 ay 
labag sa ating Saligang Batas. At nagkataon na ito ay dinala sa Korte Suprema. 
Pinapakita lamang na ang Korte Suprema ang kapakanan ng ating batas at ang 
kapakanan ng taong-bayan ang kanilang pinapairal dito sa dalawang desisyong ito.</p>

<p><i>Q: Pagdating po sa trust and confidence ng tao sa Korte Suprema, ito po ba 
ay maibabalik?</i></p>

<p>SPFMD: The Supreme Court is involved in interpretation of our Constitution 
and our laws. They should interpret the Constitution and our laws in accordance 
with legal precepts not with what is popular with the people. That is the 
difference between the judiciary and the political branches of government. The 
Supreme Court will decide as they have decided on the basis of their 
interpretation of the Constitution. Not on the basis of the popularity of the 
decision.</p>

<p><i>Q: On latest SWS survey saying the opposition should stop being 
obstructionist nagsasayang lang daw ang Senado at Kongreso sa pag-iimbestiga ng 
Hello Garci scandal</i></p>

<p>SPFMD: The matter of the Garci tapes are matters that arose because of 
questions on election cheating. Certainly, it is a legitimate inquiry on the 
part of the legislature for purposes of finding out how this episode can be 
remedied in terms of legislation. The matter of wire-tapping the President is a 
serious national security breach. The use of the ISAFP, apparently ISAFP in this 
case is for political purposes, is something that must be looked into. The 
legislature cannot just leave this matter the way they were. Because it involved 
the elections, it involved a democratic process, it involved a national security 
matter. Therefore, this is a valid inquiry that was conducted.</p>

<p><i>Q: You don't agree that what happened in the past should be left behind?</i></p>

<p>SPFMD: I don't buy that kind of principle.</p>

<p><i>Q: How was your China trip?</i></p>

<p>SPFMD: Very good.</p>

<p><i>Q: On northrail</i></p>

<p>SPFMD: Yes, I met with them and I told them that we want to make sure that 
the Northrail project does not turn out to be another white elephant as the NAIA 
3 is turning out to be.</p>

<p><i>Q: Will you resume the North Rail investigation?</i></p>

<p>SPFMD: We have already made a statement on that. We said that we will look 
into this once the decision has become final.</p>

<p><i>Q: DOJ is asking NBI to investigate the student who said patalsikin si 
Gloria</i></p>

<p>SPFMD: Ako po ay nalulungkot na iyong mga ganoong klaseng mga pangyayari ay 
binibigyan ng pansin ng dating Kalihim ng Kagawaran ng Katarungan. Maliit na 
bagay iyan, mas maraming mga bagay na dapat nilang bigyan-pansin. Iyan naman ay 
isang estudyante at karapatan po ng sinomang mamamayan na magpahayag ng kanyang 
damdamin.</p>

<p><i>Q: Two points na vs Gloria, sa tingin ninyo mabigat na dahilan na ito para 
magbitiw si Gloria?</i></p>

<p>SPFMD: Ang mga kasong ito ay nasa Korte Suprema. These are reminders to the 
President that she should stay within the bounds of the Constitution and the 
law. Because the Supreme Court will not tolerate excesses in the use of 
executive power.</p>

<p><i>Q: What about the people who gave the bad advice?</i></p>

<p>SPFMD: She should review the performance of her legal advisers.</p>

<p><i>Q: On Tatad's statement re Davide</i></p>

<p>SPFMD: This is not the first time that the issue of the age of a political 
appointee to the foreign service is brought up to the Commission on 
Appointments. In the case of Vice President Tito Guingona, the same issue was 
raised. The CA voted nevertheless to confirm the appointment and made its own 
interpretation of the provision. I believe that this is a legal issue, an 
interpretation of the Foreign Service Act of 1991, which would be best resolved 
by the courts. I urge Senator Tatad to bring this legal issue before our courts 
of law where a decision can be made. The CA as I said, previously passed on the 
same issue. It made its own interpretation as a collegial body. Therefore, the 
best way to resolve this is to bring the matter before the courts so that it can 
finally be decided. This is an interpretation of a provision of the Foreign 
Service Act.</p>

<p><i>Q: You will refer it first to the confirmation proceedings?</i></p>

<p>SPFMD: We will refer the letter of Senator Tatad to the Committee on Foreign 
Relations of the CA chaired by Sen. Miriam Defensor Santiago. As we said, this 
is an interpretation of the Foreign Service Act which I would think is best to 
be resolved by the courts.</p>

<p><i>Q: The courts?</i></p>

<p>SPFMD: By the judiciary in general. Ultimately by the Supreme Court.</p>

<p><i>Q: Where should Sen. Tatad lodge this?</i></p>

<p>SPFMD: He has lodged a petition before the regional trial court in the case 
of former Vice President Guingona. It has become academic because VP Guingona 
has withdrawn. I don't think that that will progress. I don't really know where 
the case is at this point.</p>

<p><i>Q: Does this require a civil service opinion?</i></p>

<p>SPFMD: No, this is not within the jurisdiction of the civil service. Because 
if I recall correctly, this is an exempt position. This is not covered by civil 
service rules.</p>

<p><i>Q: On the abolition of death penalty?</i></p>

<p>SPFMD: I have not received any presidential certification.</p>

<p><i>Q: Sen. Pimentel is asking the Senate leadership to prioritize the bill 
seeking abolition of the death penalty.</i></p>

<p>SPFMD: The moment it is certified as a measure, that will be referred to the 
Committee on Rules. Yes, ordinarily it is given priority.</p>

<p><i>Q: Are you in favor of the abolition of the death penalty?</i></p>

<p>SPFMD: I signed a bill before together with Senator Pimentel on the abolition 
of the death penalty.</p>

<p><i>Q: According to the Chief Justice unconstitutional ang death penalty?</i></p>

<p>SPFMD: That is a personal opinion of the Chief Justice. We would like to 
think that it is the Supreme Court which will ultimately rule on this if it is 
brought squarely before it.</p>

<p><i>Q: In terms of opposing cha-cha, what have we achieved so far?</i></p>

<p>SPFMD: We have expressed our sentiments. We believe as the Senate passed a 
resolution, expressing the sense of the Senate that the people's initiative is 
illegal. And not based on any law. (end)</p>
