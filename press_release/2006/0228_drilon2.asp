Press Release<br /><!-- NewsDate.start -->February 28, 2006<!-- NewsDate.end --><p style="text-align: center">
<span class="PRTitle"><!-- NewsTitle.start -->Gov't agents conducting illegal arrests, 
seizures <br />detention face criminal liability, Drilon warns<!-- NewsTitle.end --></span></p>
<!-- NewsBody.start --><p>Senate President and Liberal Party head Franklin 
Drilon today warned that police and military officials who continue to conduct 
illegal arrests, seizures and detention may incur criminal and administrative 
liabilities, or be liable for damages even under Proclamation 1017 that placed 
the country under a state of emergency.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In an interview, Drilon maintained that the Bill of Rights was still in 
effect and government officials, such as officers of the Philippine National 
Police (PNP) and the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP), who conduct illegal 
arrests, seizures and illegal detain persons can be sued before the courts.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&quot;Admittedly, good faith is a defense because they can claim to be simply 
performing their duties. But if it is shown that there was bad faith or malice 
in the performance of their duties, certainly these police officers can be 
charged in court,&quot; Drilon said when asked if government agents who implement 
illegal arrest were free from criminal liability under Proclamation 1017.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Proclamation 1017, Drilon explained, does not exempt the agents of government 
from liability. &quot;These police officers must be responsible for what they do and 
if it can be shown that there was malice on the part of these officers; that 
they knowingly commit unlawful acts, they can be liable for damages,&quot; Drilon 
said.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Senate President said existing laws against illegal arrest, seizures and 
detention by the police were still in effect and were not suspended by 
Proclamation 1017.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Drilon deplored that the Arroyo administration was violating the civil 
liberties of those who were being arrested without the benefit of arrest 
warrants and condemned the government takeover of the operations of the Daily 
Tribune newspaper.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&quot;The acts that they have committed under the guise of 1017 are totally 
unconstitutional,&quot; Drilon said. &quot;Proclamation 1017 is a legal superfluity. The 
proclamation simply stated a state of national emergency. However, it would 
appear that it has metamorphosed into an emergency rule&quot; Drilon said.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In the same interview, Drilon also contradicted the statement of Justice 
Secretary Raul Gonzalez and PNP Director General Arturo Lomibao that the police 
can arrest suspects without the benefit of an arrest warrant because rebellion 
is a continuing crime.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&quot;That concept of a continuing crime is a much abused principle at this point. 
It is being used to justify illegal arrests and detention of government critics. 
The legal reasoning is really stretched. I think the Supreme Court, to calm 
people down, should issue a restraining order to stop these illegal arrests. 
This is just terrible,&quot; Drilon said.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A warrantless arrest can only be effected, according to Drilon, when in the 
presence of the arresting officer, a crime is committed, a crime is about to be 
committed, or is actually being committed.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In the absence of the above conditions, Drilon, a former secretary of 
justice, said the duty of the government is to file a case with the Department 
of Justice, allow the respondents to file counter-affidavits, and if the 
department believes that a crime has been committed, to file a case in court. 
The court may then issue a warrant of arrest which can be served on the accused.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Drilon said that a public officer who detains a person without a warrant may 
be found guilty of arbitrary detention or may be made answerable for damages.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&quot;In other words, 1017 has its chilling effects. The government has taken 
advantage of this chilling effect. Without any regard for the freedoms of the 
people, they [the government] have suppressed and are trying to suppress the 
freedom of expression, freedom of speech and civil rights, like what they have 
done to media.&quot;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Drilon also pointed out that under the present Constitution, even a 
declaration of martial law by the President was not enough to suspend the Bill 
of Rights.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&quot;Even in a martial law or a suspension of the writ of habeas corpus, the Bill 
of Rights, by express provision of the Constitution, is still in full effect,&quot; 
Drilon said.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&quot;The right to information, the freedom of expression, the right to free 
speech, the right against unreasonable searches are all contained in the Bill of 
Rights. Even under martial law, these rights can not be suspended; much less 
under a state of national emergency,&quot; Drilon said.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&quot;That is very clear. Under the Constitution, a declaration of martial law 
does not result in the suspension of basic rights,&quot; Drilon said.</p>
<p></p>
<p>He pointed out that Supreme Court, in the Sanlakas versus the Executive 
Secterary case, has ruled that even the declaration of a State of Rebellion in 
the country does not result in the suspension of basic civil liberties such as 
freedom of the press.</p>
<p></p>
<p>On Monday, Drilon led a bipartisan group of senators in passing a resolution 
condemning the &quot;raid and exercise of control over print media, the warrantless 
arrest of several citizens including a member of the House of Representatives 
and other similar acts carried out by the government pursuant to Proclamation 
No. 1017 issued by President Arroyo.&quot; Eleven other senators, both from the 
majority and minority, co-sponsored the resolution.</p>
<p>&quot;As liberals and advocates of liberal democracy, we can not stand idle while 
overzealous functionaries of President Arroyo trample upon the rights of the 
Filipino people under the guise of an imagined national emergency,&quot; Drilon said.</p>
