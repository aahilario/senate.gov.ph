Press Release<br /><!-- NewsDate.start -->October 17, 2006<!-- NewsDate.end --><p>
<span class="PRTitle"><!-- NewsTitle.start -->Interview of Sen. Recto with Korina Sanchez on the 2007 budget<!-- NewsTitle.end --></span><br /><span class="PRSub"><!-- NewsTitleSub.start -->*Korina Today, ANC*<!-- NewsTitleSub.end--></span></p>
<!-- NewsBody.start --><p><i>(How do you think this will be received at the Senate?)</i></p>
<p>Were glad that  the House passed their budget version early enough so that the 1^st or  2^nd week of November this could easily be transmitted to the Senate.  The Senate has already had roughly 90% of the hearings conducted by the  cmtee on finance w/ regard to the natl expenditure program submitted  by  the president to us. I am confident & I think its imperative for the  Senate to act on the budget so that we do have a 2007 budget next yr  and  not a reenacted reenacted budget.</p>
<p><i>(Do you think you share this sentiment w/ the rest of the senators,  that  there not going to be prolonging the process?)</i></p>
<p>Definitely the Senate  will try to make improvements on the budget but its imperative for us  to pass a budget. At the end of the end, if we dont pass a budget &  you  have a reenacted reenacted budget, that will be giving less value for  money for our taxpayers. We will be shortchanging them, in effect, so  its important that we pass the budget.</p>
<p>But let me highlight a few points, Korina. The budget for next year  based on the current budget in 2006, which is a reenacted budget plus a  supplemental budget, is roughly about P140B more. So Id like to see  where the P140B went to. It would appear to me that based on the  initial  hearings that we had in the Senate, only P10B of this went to capital  outlay, in addition. Then we know for a fact that we have the  millennium  development goal. At the end of the day, its all about poverty  reduction, creating wealth and creating jobs. So wed like to find out  how many jobs will this (budget) create next year, what will be the  reduction in poverty incidence, for example, will this be in the  millennium development goal in 2007? We know for a fact that there are  many challenges in education & health. To achieve the millennium  development goal, there is a shortfall of about P380B between now and  2015, not to mention the SONA commitments of the president on  infrastructure. And we know that on education alone for next year,  theres a shortfall of P32B. Then if you were to include health, then  thats another P3.5B.</p>
<p>So theres an increase of P140B over the current year. The president,  by  and large, has discretion in the net of roughly P240B, so Im sure the  Senate can still make improvements on the NEP (national expenditures  program) and possibly improvements from the House version.</p>
<p><i>(So what youre saying is you might even add on to this  trillion-something budget?)</i></p>
<p>We will be reallocating funds. Congress is  not allowed to increase the budget. We can only reallocate the funds  within the budget submitted by the president.</p>
<p><i>(How do you intend to do that? Are you in agreement about decreasing  debt servicing?)</i></p>
<p>Thats automatic. In fact thats not part of the  discretionary funds. And the debt service component, the interest  expense is a fixed cost. This has been contracted in previous years &  based on the current exchange rate and interest rate, thats the main  reason why the interest expense is going down.</p>
<p><i>(You did mention a wealth of what I might say valid issues, do you  think  you can make all of these improvements within a reasonable amount of  time?)</i></p>
<p>Definitely, because many of us in the Senate, same thing in the  House, have been members of Congress for the last decade at least. So  theres a lot of learning curve already there, a lot of experience when  it comes to budgeting and the revenues and expenditures of govt, and  the program that each of the department do. So I think many of us would  have the knowledge of how to realign the budget and make it more  responsive to the needs of the population.</p>
<p><i>(So if you were to mention 3 of the items that are wanting in  improvement, what would those be?)</i></p>
<p>How will this affect poverty  reduction? How will this create job? These are the 1st questions asked  in the US Congress when the budgeted was presented. How many jobs will  this create for our poor people? How many will be lifted from poverty?  Then they go to the nitty gritties already. In our case naman, Im  looking at infrastructure so that we casn make the economy grow at a  sustainable rate or even at a better rate. Then were looking at  education and health. Im concerned in 6 areas: health, education,  agriculture, roads and infrastructure, technology and security or  HEARTS. These are the 6 programs that we should give emphasis on.</p>
<p><i>(My last question, just by looking at numbers, do you think that the  SONA promises of the president, those gargantuan infrastructure  projects, can that be realized w/ that kind of a budget?)</i></p>
<p>Definitely,  with this kind of a budget I dont think that the SONA commitments will  be accomplished by 2010. And I dont know if the president really said  that she wanted to finish her SONA commitments by 2010. And I dont  fault her for that, by and large, because the idea is to give a long  term vision for the country, as well as infrastructure that needs to be  developed over a period of time. Hindi naman pupuwede that  infrastructure projects that we build tapos kailangan within 3 years  lang because were elected every 3 yrs. There must be work in progress.  But definitely, there is no doubt that these infrastructure projects  that she mentioned, and even more, need to be done.</p>
<p>Thats why Im saying earlier, Korina, that for the 2007 budget, the  increase in capital outlay is only P10B. that is insignificant. I think  we should be able to provide more resources for improving our  infrastructure. I mentioned also that the budget is roughly P140B more  than the previous year, not to mention that Malacanang really has a say  with regard to roughly P200 plus Billion in discretionary fund. If you  were to follow a zero-based budgeting approach, or for example lets  divide the budget into fixed cost and variable cost, so youll know  that  the president has a say on P240B of where you should allocate this  money.</p>
