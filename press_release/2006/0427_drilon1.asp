Press Release<br /><!-- NewsDate.start -->April 27, 2006<!-- NewsDate.end --><p style="text-align: left">
<span class="PRTitle"><!-- NewsTitle.start -->Transcript of Interview with Senate 
President Franklin M. Drilon over ANC 
<br />(April 26, 2006)<!-- NewsTitle.end --></span></p>
<!-- NewsBody.start --><p align="justify"><i>Q: Even if you are on recess, you can actually 
pursue committee hearings on the defense by Sen. Pong Biazon on the wiretapping 
controversy. Is that something that will happen in the near future?</i></p>

<p align="justify">SPFMD: It depends upon the chairs with the different committees but that is 
correct. This standing resolution which allows the committees to conduct 
hearings even while we are on recess. Because ordinarily when we are on recess, 
the committees are not functioning but we have a resolution which allows the 
committees to continue to make inquiries if the chair would find it rigid to do 
so.</p>

<p align="justify"><i>Q: Do you think this is going to happen prior to May 15?</i></p>

<p align="justify">SPFMD: It really depends on the chairs of the different committees.</p>

<p align="justify"><i>Q: You said you would be going around for some campaign on the 
anti-cha-cha initiative.</i></p>

<p align="justify">SPFMD: There were some senators who expressed preference, I'm not really 
aware of what they have done so far.</p>

<p align="justify"><i>Q: But the Resign Gloria Movement, did that even progress?</i></p>

<p align="justify">SPFMD: There are sectors who continue to advocate for that particular Gloria 
Resign Movement which a number of us started in the Senate.</p>

<p align="justify"><i>Q: How many Senate committees you think will be interested right now to 
pursue their investigations?</i></p>

<p align="justify">SPFMD: I don't really know. There are a number of things; there are a number 
of inquiries which are ongoing. Let me put things in the proper perspective. 
What the Supreme Court did was to reaffirm what is already in the Constitution. 
Under Art. 6 Section 21, we have the power to investigate in aid of legislation 
and for purposes of ferreting out information which are in the public interest. 
Under Sec. 22, we have the so-called question hour wherein the cabinet 
secretaries can be summoned before the Senate or the House either on their own 
volition or in accordance with our rules. The SC said that the authority of the 
Congress to conduct inquiries in aid of legislation and investigations cannot be 
curtailed by EO 464, and therefore, it struck down as unconstitutional those 
pertinent provisions of EO 464 which would encroach on the legislative authority 
of Congress to make inquiries in aid of legislation. However, insofar as the 
question hour is concerned, the SC correctly said that under the Constitution, 
the cabinet secretaries can be prevented by the President from appearing. The 
Supreme Court affirmed the authority of Congress to make inquiries in aid of 
legislation. You ask me how many inquires are there? There are a number of 
inquiries except that some inquiries are given prominence than others because of 
the nature of media.</p>

<p align="justify"><i>Q: Let us refresh the memories of our viewers.</i></p>

<p align="justify">SPFMD: The fertilizer funds scamThe Committee on Agriculture and the Blue 
Ribbon Committee submitted a report to the Senate that made a very clear 
reservation on Jocjoc Bolante. By the way, Jocjoc Bolante is not covered by EO 
464 even while it was implemented because he was no longer a government 
official. It was USec. Belinda Gonzales and the others who invoked EO 464, even 
some Vice President of GSIS invoked EO 464. Going back to that, the two 
committees submitted a report. This is without prejudice to compelling Jocjoc 
Bolante should we find him; there were news that he came back, I could not 
verify that. He can be brought to the Senate to testify. The Hello Garci 
investigationSenator Biazon said that he intends to continue as he has been 
continuing the hearings of the Hello Garci controversy. Insofar as the 
Northrail, we will await once the decision will be final. We will resume the 
hearings because we do not want the Northrail project to suffer the same fate as 
the NAIA III contract which because of questions raised, up to now it could not 
be operated. The government is facing a $900-million case in Singapore and 
Washington and we don't want a repeat of the same scenario. We want the budget 
to be executed in accordance with the Philippine laws. That is all that we are 
interested in.</p>

<p align="justify"><i>Q: Do you see a problem with the cabinet officials or the President 
invoking executive privilege?</i></p>

<p align="justify">SPFMD: It has not been a problem because executive privilege has always been 
recognized. In fact, our rules provide where in matters where an executive 
session would be necessary, we would have an executive session to prevent the 
information from being banded around where it serves no purpose. We have very 
strict rules on that. In fact a senator who would reveal proceedings taken in 
the executive session could be subjected to discipline by the Chamber.</p>

<p align="justify"><i>Q: During the Venable contract hearing, I don't remember the NSC Adviser 
really invoking executive privilege, but to my mind it can actually fan out the 
same way it did during the Venable contract inquiry.</i></p>

<p align="justify">SPFMD: First, we have rules which would determine when an executive privilege 
can be invoked, for example, in cases where national security is concerned, in 
cases where state secrets are concerned.</p>

<p align="justify"><i>Q: That's exactly the problem with the incident with Norberto Gonzales</i></p>

<p align="justify">SPFMD: That's why it happened when it happened because we may not agree that 
national security was involved. Seeking funding from Washington in order that 
you can fund a charter change is something that nobody would believe involves 
national security.</p>

<p align="justify"><i>Q: What happens if this becomes subjective, this invoking executive 
privilege because one thinks it is a state secret or for national security 
purposes and you think otherwise?</i></p>

<p align="justify">SPFMD: It's theoretical. I'm just making a theoretical basis. We determine 
and we have bigger judgment as to the nature of the testimony. The president can 
invoke executive privilege if it really involves national security etc. We, the 
senators, are reasonable people. We are responsible. We are not gungho and just 
making inquiries for the sake of making inquiries as Malaca&ntilde;ang
 would want to 
project. But at the end of the day, assuming that there is an honest difference 
in opinion, ultimately the courts will have to decide.</p>

<p align="justify"><i>Q: You will eventually have to leave it to the courts?</i></p>

<p align="justify">SPFMD: That's correct, yes. That is how the system should work.</p>

<p align="justify"><i>Q: Some cabinet secretaries said that we hope the Senate would not abuse 
its power in using in aid of legislation?</i></p>

<p align="justify">SPFMD: Good media spin, but let me assure our people that your senators are 
responsible enough. I've been serving in government for the past 20 years. We 
know the bounds of decency. We are responsible to the people who elected us into 
office. We are not responsible to Malaca&ntilde;ang
.</p>

<p align="justify"><i>Q: On CPR, some of the petitioners were not quite happy. What they really 
want is to strike down BP 880.</i></p>

<p align="justify">SPFMD: Batas Pambansa 880 provides and regulates the exercise the freedom of 
assembly, freedom of speech. In fact, it seeks to regulate it for the public 
good and that is what the Supreme Court said. You have two extremes here: those 
who say we should have untrammeled liberty to exercise our freedom of assembly 
and those in Malaca&ntilde;ang
 who says you cannot exercise. The first indication of 
inconvenience to the public, we will stop you. The Supreme Court correctly laid 
down the rules which would put order in rallies but, very clearly, allowing 
people to express their sentiments. BP 880 laid down the rules. What would 
become crucial here is on May 1. As I was watching your program, there are five 
rally sites as indicated. What is important here is that the police and the 
authorities should allow the rallies to the site. Do not stop them on the 
streets as what they are doing now.</p>

<p align="justify"><i>Q: That could be the problem, making their way to Liwasang Bonifacio</i></p>

<p align="justify">SPFMD: That is correct. The maximum tolerance is we should allow them to 
march towards these rally sights. You cannot stop them and say you have no 
permit to march in this street. That cannot be done. You cannot stop the rallies 
from walking on the street as long as they do not obstruct the traffic to allow 
reasonable passage. On the way to Liwasang Bonifacio, Plaza Moriones and the 
other places with no permit is necessary while they march along.</p>

<p align="justify"><i>Q: That might pose a problem...?</i></p>

<p align="justify">SPFMD: It should be no problem; there is no gray area there. That is very 
clear. They are marching toward the rally site, as long as they don't block 
passage of transportation, they should be allowed. They should not be stopped in 
front of UST and say you cannot go to the plaza because you don't have permit to 
walk on the streets. That is the most idiotic and stupid incident. This one of 
Dinky Soliman, can you imagine in Roxas Blvd., and suddenly they say you have no 
permit to walk to cross the street?</p>

<p align="justify"><i>Q: But that was done Senate President</i></p>

<p align="justify">SPFMD: It was done because of the stupidity of the way the CPR was being 
interpreted by the police. The Supreme Court says there is no such thing, it 
just beclouds, it just creates a power which should not be there. That's what 
the police did; they arrested Dinky Soliman for crossing Roxas Blvd.</p>

<p align="justify"><i>Q: Can they actually press charges against these police officials plus 
Ermita and even the President?</i></p>

<p align="justify">SPFMD: There is jurisprudence which makes the public official liable for 
abuse of authority. They are not given any protection when you abuse the 
authority delegated to you by the state and public officials can be liable for 
damages. That is an established doctrine.</p>

<p align="justify"><i>Q: How do we reconcile the fact that the police implemented this because 
the executive said we are implementing CPR?</i></p>

<p align="justify">SPFMD: The police is part of the executive and therefore if police officials 
abuse, they can be liable. That's why I'm emphasizing, the deciding cases would 
support the proposition that an abuse of authority would expose the public 
official to damages and that's settled in a number of cases.</p>

<p align="justify"><i>Q: We see what happens on May 1</i></p>

<p align="justify">SPFMD: Let see what happens on May 1.</p>

<p align="justify"><i>Q: On the student who possessed Resign Arroyo slogans</i></p>
<p align="justify">SPFMD: I've said that in July last year.</p>

<p align="justify"><i>Q: They should order a probe on you</i></p>

<p align="justify">SPFMD: They should order a probe on me. Secretary Gonzalez likewise directed 
the NBI to start investigating Probe for the interview with that Oakwood 
mutineer. It's quite sad that these things happen. The intimidation continues. 
The chilling effect of the statements of the Secretary of Justice -- who has 
this arsenal the investigative arm, the NBI and the prosecutorial arm of 
government in his direction, and control 2,000 prosecutors all over the country, 
hundreds of NBI agents,-- ordering an investigation on a placard-raising in a 
graduation ceremony in Cavite State university and ordering the investigation of 
Probe. The president is not the state. There's nothing seditious in what the 
student did nor can Che-Che Lazaro of Probe be charged with plotting to bring 
down government. It is quite unfortunate that these investigations are being 
ordered. It has certainly a chilling effect on people. People have the right to 
information insofar as Probe is concerned. The people have the right to know. 
The Justice Secretary ordering an investigation of Probe does not augur well for 
our freedoms in this country.</p>

<p align="justify"><i>Q: Is it not his responsibility as Justice Secretary to probe the student 
and Probe?</i></p>

<p align="justify">SPFMD: It is within his authority, no question about it. Precisely, the 
exercise of ordering an investigation of this nature, which we know is nothing 
more but a design to intimidate. I am certain that at the end of the day, no 
charges will be filed because there is no case. I recall on May 1, when I was 
Secretary of Labor, remember it was during those turbulent years when labor 
groups wanted to exercise their newly acquired freedom. 1987 was the second 
Labor day. We just allowed them to march and make their demands on government. 
There were no arrests made. The government continued to function. It was the 
series of coup d'etats that put the duly-constituted government is in danger but 
not the rallies. Probe did not commit any act of sedition nor did that student 
who raised a placard. They should learn to tolerate dissent in a democracy. 
That's the essence of democracy.</p>

<p align="justify"><i>Q: What would you say if you were the president and a student shouted that 
to you?</i></p>

<p align="justify">SPFMD: It comes with the turf. You are a political leader. You cannot make 
everybody agree no matter how good intentioned you are. We have an open society. 
This is the kind of society we want to be. It may be irritating, but that's part 
of the game.</p>

<p align="justify"><i>Q: What will the Senate do once sessions resume?</i></p>

<p align="justify">SPFMD: We will pass the budget in the Senate. How it will turn out in the 
bicameral conference committee is beyond my control.</p>

<p align="justify"><i>Q: You are confident you will pass it before June 9 or 10?</i></p>

<p align="justify">SPFMD: We will pass it before June 9 or 10. I am confident about that insofar 
as the Senate is concerned.</p>

<p align="justify"><i>Q: When did the House submit the budget?</i></p>

<p align="justify">SPFMD: It was transmitted to us on April 5, 24 hours before we adjourned.</p>

<p align="justify"><i>Q: You were holding simultaneous hearings on the budget</i></p>

<p align="justify">SPFMD: We have practically heard all of the budgets of the different 
departments. We are prepared to Senate the budget on the floor. I know which 
portions to question.</p>

<p align="justify"><i>Q: What are the portions you are going to question?</i></p>

<p align="justify">SPFMD: The lump sum pork barrel, like what they call the Kilos Asenso and the 
Kalayaan Fund, that's P8 billion. Other senators have their own areas to 
examine. We more or less know how the budget will be shaped insofar as the 
Senate is concerned.</p>

<p align="justify"><i>Q: Did you take into account the possibility of lowering tariff on 
imported fuel?</i></p>

<p align="justify">SPFMD: Under the Constitution, the authority to reduce tariffs is with the 
President when Congress is not in session. There is news that they are going to 
reduce the tariff. Once the tariff is reduced, when the President exercised that 
authority, we will look how the reduction in revenue will affect the expenditure 
program of the government. But until we know for certainty the presidential 
directive, we will assume that the full impact of the VAT is the premise of the 
2006 budget.</p>

<p align="justify"><i>Q: What would you recommend, lowering the tariff, suspending the RVAT.</i></p>

<p align="justify">SPFMD: The tariff is a matter which is within the President's prerogative 
Malaca&ntilde;ang
, I understand, is looking into the tariff insofar as oil products are 
concerned in order to cushion the impact of the oil price increases. At the same 
time, however, this will have an effect on revenue collection. And the revenue 
collection will have an effect on the expenditure program. We will wait what the 
President will do and we will act accordingly insofar as the budget is 
concerned.</p>

<p align="justify"><i>Q: There is no inclination on which proposal to support?</i></p>

<p align="justify">SPFMD: Insofar as the EVAT is concerned, I was one of those who had 
reservations about imposing an EVAT on power. Because first, it was not certain 
what the revenues will be realized out of imposing a VAT on power. But the 
effect on the consumer is very clear and the inflationary tendency is clear 
insofar as the additional burden is concerned. It is for this reason that there 
were nine senators who voted against EVAT on power.</p>

<p align="justify"><i>Q: Is there a recommendation now for the suspension of VAT on power rates?</i></p>

<p align="justify">SPFMD: There is none in the Senate.</p>

<p align="justify"><i>Q: On cha-cha</i></p>

<p align="justify">SPFMD: I was just watching TV Patrol. Comelec said it will take us quite a 
number of months to be able to verify. In fact, they have to resort to X, Y, Z 
kind of process. They have their own process because there were no guidelines 
from the Comelec. They said they are doing this for the first time and that only 
is a problem that they have to face and it will take time, apart from the fact 
that there is no enabling law, apart from the fact that even if there is an 
enabling law, the constitution is clear that a people's initiative cannot be 
used for purposes of a revision of the Constitution. Simple amendments, yes, but 
revision, no. Chief Justice Panganiban in his dissent in the case of Defensor 
Santiago vs. Comelec asked the question, for whose benefit is the people's 
initiative be legally taken then? That same question should be validly asked 
when the case comes before the court.</p>

<p align="justify"><i>Q: How many votes does a senator need to make it to the Top 5?</i></p>

<p align="justify">SPFMD: About 11 million.</p>

<p align="justify"><i>Q: One of the columnists said it is quite absurd that the people's 
initiative had began on a Saturday and by Monday, the Sigaw ng Bayan had already 
counted 2 million votes, is that possible?</i></p>

<p align="justify">SPFMD: Obviously, this is just sigaw, nothing else. All noise. Let's leave it 
at that. (end)</p>
