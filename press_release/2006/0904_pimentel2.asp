<!-- NewsBody.start --><p>Mr. President:</p>
<p style="text-indent: 25px">On February 29, 2004, a major story of the 
Philippine Daily Inquirer upset my early morning equanimity. It said in bold 
letters: 'Doctor-topnotcher leaving as nurse'.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 25px">The article written by Volt Contreras told the 
poignant story of a young man who grew up in Basilan, the troubled island in 
Mindanao, but who overcame:
<!-- NewsBody.end -->
</p>
<blockquote>
	<p><i>&quot;the tough and troubling conditions of his now infamous hometown of 
	Lamitan, Basilan, to become a consistent scholar and honor student all his 
	life-an achievement that was crowned this week by his topnotcher finish in 
	the medical board exams.&quot; The young man, Elmer Jacinto, &quot;scored 86.75% and 
	topped the field of 1,825 examinees, 948 of whom passed.&quot;</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-indent: 25px">What actually depressed me were the next few lines 
in the story that said:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>&quot;This inspiring story of triumph against the odds is, however, about to 
	turn into another sad statistic of the state of the nation.&quot;</p>
	<p>&quot;Jacinto, who graduated magna cum laude from Our Lady of Fatima 
	University's College of Medicine in Valenzuela, Bulacan, has said he not 
	only plans to leave the country but has chosen not to work as a doctor. Long 
	before he took the board exams, Jacinto had already applied for a job in the 
	United States-as a nurse in a New York hospital.</p>
	<p>&quot;While it pains me to do so, I'm looking forward to going abroad and not 
	to let the opportunity pass,'' said Jacinto in an interview on Friday. &quot;If 
	only the [job] market for medicine graduates were good here,'' said the 
	28-year-old bachelor.&quot;</p>
	<p>&quot;Regretfully, many [doctors] have chosen to become nurses abroad because 
	the pay here is no longer commensurate to what they have attained in the 
	profession. It has become a trend,'' he said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i><u>Sell-out?</u></i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 25px">Five days later, on March 4, 2004, in an editorial, 
The Inquirer criticized Jacinto's plans in this wise:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p><i>&quot;THE TOPNOTCHER of the recent board exams for medical graduates makes 
	no bones about his target: big bucks. He means to make his pile as a nurse 
	in the United States, where the demand for nurses is such that Filipinos 
	with a nursing degree are heading there literally in droves. xxx</i></p>
	<p><i>&quot;(H)e epitomizes a poignant twist in the Filipino quest for employment 
	overseas, a &quot;trend,&quot; he calls it: physicians returning to school to acquire 
	the precious nursing degree that would equip them to join the foreign legion 
	now laboring in US hospitals. xxx</i></p>
	<p><i>&quot;Disturbing? But you could say that Elmer Reyes Jacinto is well within 
	his rights to plan his life according to the dictates of commerce, no matter 
	that by his own reckoning, he is no stranger to books and, presumably, to 
	the life of the mind. xxx</i></p>
	<p><i>&quot;In fact, as Jacinto himself tells it, his father has come to grips 
	with the paramount value of money and where it can be found: &quot;There's no 
	money in writing.&quot; But in nursing there is, according to the father's 
	estimation-a point that the son has taken to heart.</i></p>
	<p><i>&quot;This is what we have come to in this country of our afflictions, 
	where young (28), bright (magna cum laude in medicine) offspring of 
	middle-class professionals (teachers in mathematics, science and English), 
	yet unencumbered by the challenges of life (single, no children), throw in 
	the towel before even putting up a fight.</i></p>
	<p><i>What a sellout.&quot;</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-indent: 25px">On March 15, 2004, I was the guest speaker at the 
oath-taking ceremonies of the new medical graduates headed by Elmer Jacinto.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 25px">Among other things, I said that &quot;we cannot begrudge 
you (about your plans to go abroad) but only appeal to you to stay.&quot;</p>
<p><i><u>Terrible Indictment</u></i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 25px">The Inquirer story on the oath-taking quoted me as 
saying that </p>
<blockquote>
	<p><i>&quot;Jacinto's case represented a terrible indictment of the state of our 
	society, where very competent professionals, young and adventurous, would 
	feel the need to take another course to escape dire conditions. We cannot 
	blame him, but still, it's a sad commentary on the state of our society.&quot;</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-indent: 25px">That was a rather long introduction to the sad 
story that I am about to tell this Chamber. But it had to be told so that my own 
frustration over the developments I speak of would be better appreciated.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 25px">In any case, it is a sorrow-filled story of some of 
the best and the brightest of our medical professionals who were lured by the 
promise of a better life out of the country. They have found out for themselves 
that the honeyed words they had relied upon were laced with large doses of 
bitter circumstances when they disembarked on the shores of the promised-land.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 25px">It is also a depressing story because it validates 
the observation made by the more perceptive among our people that many of our 
professionals now readily place their expertise to serve the interests of 
countries rather than ours. While I understand the reason for it, I think it is 
even more distressing to witness the sad spectacle of some people taking up 
medicine as a pre-course before they become nurses, just so they can reach the 
promised-land where they think the grass is greener than our locally grown ones.
</p>
<p><u>Brown grass</u></p>
<p style="text-indent: 25px">Unfortunately, the nurses we speak of have found to 
their discomfiture that the grass there is even browner, more parched and drier 
than ours.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 25px">If their disappointment was merely that they were 
duped by their recruiter, I would like to say that my disillusionment is deeper 
than theirs. My regret is that they had to leave the country at all at a time 
when our people need them the most. </p>
<p><i><u>Their way</u></i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 25px">In any case, this was how the story - the story of 
present pain and, we hope, eventual glory - of our nurses began.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 25px">Many nurses were sent to New York last year and the 
year before by a locally registered agency that carried the name of Sentosa 
Recruitment Agency. Please note the name carefully: Sentosa Recruitment Agency 
because by some stratagem, as the recruiter of the nurses, it shifted the 
responsibility of handling in the US to a US- based firm known as Sentosa Bent 
Philipson. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 25px">The transfer of responsibility was done by the 
Sentosa Recruitment Agency without the consent of the nurses. Neither did it 
introduce them to the person or persons who would now supervise their affairs 
leading to their deployment. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 25px">But before I proceed, Mr. President, may I put into 
the record the names, the dates of birth and the places of origin of the nurses 
whose travails we are narrating here.</p>
<p><i><u>Our constituents</u></i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 25px">From the files of their lawyers, Felix Vinluan and 
Tim Calumpong, we got their names and other personal circumstances as follows:</p>

<p style="text-indent: 25px">I took pains to put on record their places of 
origin so that those of us who come from the same places may better empathize 
with their problem because we might know them personally or their parents and 
relatives. In my case, four of the complaining nurses come from Mindanao which I 
have the honor to represent in this chamber. They are: Fe L. Cinco of Medina, 
Misamis Oriental; Mark M. de la Cruz of Zamboanga City; Elmer Jacinto of 
Basilan, and Mitzi Ann Ong of Cagayan de Oro.</p>
<p><i><u>Contracts violated</u></i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 25px">The nurses are now all deployed in various health 
facilities in the state of New York except one, Eileen Magnaye, a professor in a 
local school of nursing. She came back home when she found out that her 
recruiter did not comply with the terms of their contract. Her complaint is 
basically the complaint also of the other nurses.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 25px">When the nurses were being recruited here, the 
Sentosa Recruitment Agency made the following commitments, among other things, 
to them:</p>
<blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		<p>1. competitive salary ranging from $21 to $35 per hour;<br />2. medical coverage;<br />3. relocation and housing allowance;<br />4. free malpractice insurance;<br />5. free airfare from Manila to New York;<br />6. reimbursement of processing certification &amp; licensure fees;<br />7. generous shift differentials and flexible 8 and 12 hours schedules; 
		and<br />8. comprehensive training.</p>
	</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><i><u>Different recruiter?</u></i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 25px">But when they got to New York, not only did they 
not get what was promised to them, to repeat, their original recruiter turned 
them over to Sentosa Bent Philipson, a New York-based agency. From its name, 
Sentosa Bent Philipson appears to have a different legal personality from the 
Sentosa Recruitment Agency, the Manila-based entity. To complicate the legal 
tangle that enmeshed the nurses even more, Sentosa Bent Philipson seems to have 
passed the nurses on to the custody of Sentosa Care, LLC, a limited liability 
company based in New York, allegedly, a healthcare management company. 
Apparently, it is a company that runs nursing homes in New York. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 25px">That was not the end of the buck-passing by Sentosa 
of its contractual responsibility with the nurses it had recruited. There was 
another entity that got involved in the already tangled web of the travails of 
the nurses. It is called Prompt Nursing Employment Agency/Sentosa Services, a 
New York-based nursing employment agency, which now appears to be the actual 
employer of the sponsored nurses. And yet, it is not registered as a principal 
of Sentosa Recruitment Agency with the POEA. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 25px">To add to their problems, when they were already in 
New York, the person who sort of shepherded them was Francis Luyon, the person 
who runs the Manila based Sentosa Recruitment Agency. But he was not of much 
help. In the words of Eileen Magnaye, </p>
<blockquote>
	<p><i>&quot;he did not even know the addresses and other circumstances of the 
	medical facilities to which we were being deployed. He also did not help us 
	complete the documents supporting our permits to work. Worse, we did not get 
	the pay rates promised us when we were being recruited in Manila and we were 
	housed in a leaking abandoned house which we had to furnish by scrounging 
	around for utensils, chairs and other things thrown away by their owners.&quot;</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-indent: 25px">She also told me that some of the nurses were 
assigned individually to take care of more than 35 patients who </p>
<blockquote>
	<p><i>&quot;were bed ridden and had to be induced to take the medication 
	prescribed for them. As a consequence, they had to spend more time with the 
	patients than was previously agreed upon and this, without any overtime 
	pay.&quot;</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-indent: 25px">That was why in desperation, they engaged the 
services of their lawyers, Felix Vinluan in New York and Tim Calumpong in 
Manila, to renounce their contract and sue for their rights here.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 25px">At this point, Sentosa Bent Philipson counter 
attacked in the US. It sought the intervention of US senator Charles Schumer. 
Mr. Schumer - it must stressed - did what many of us, senators do in behalf of 
our constituents. He wrote letters to Consul General Cecilia Rebong in New York, 
the then Secretary of Labor Pat Sto. Tomas and to POEA Administrator Rosalinda 
Baldoz in Manila.</p>
<p><i><u>Diplomatese from Schumer</u></i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 25px">Let me say that the letters of Senator Schumer are 
messages steeped in diplomatese and they are missives that can hardly be faulted 
in any respect.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 25px">And If I were in the place of Senator Schumer, I 
would have probably done the same thing: forward the complaint of a constituent 
to the authorities who could do something about the matter.</p>
<p><i><u>Rebong meeting</u></i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 25px">Soon after Schumer's intercession, Atty. Vinluan 
said that Consul General Rebong</p>
<blockquote>
	<p><i>&quot;arranged to meet with us and the nurses. In the meeting, which was 
	attended by her, her deputy and the two consuls in New York, as well as five 
	nurses, she said that considering how politically well connected Sentosa's 
	Bent Philipson is, that I should have expected that Sentosa would look for a 
	&quot;padrino&quot; in the Philippines.&quot;</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-indent: 25px">Indeed, aside from invoking Senator Schumer's 
assistance in New York, Sentosa Bent Philipson also found a &quot;padrino&quot; in Manila. 
The Manila patron of Sentosa was none other than the all around factotum of 
President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, Secretary Michael Defensor. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 25px">Apparently, Secretary Defensor lost no time to make 
his influence felt in the case that the nurses had filed against Sentosa. Consul 
General Rebong told the nurses and Atty. Vinluan in the meeting mentioned 
earlier that she had received a phone call from the Secretary. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 25px">The acts of Secretary Defensor were a far cry from 
those of Senator Schumer. While the US Senator did his intervention in the open 
and with complete transparency, Secretary Defensor preferred to do his thing as 
it were under cover of darkness, that is, behind the scenes.</p>
<p><i><u>Dark maneuvers</u></i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 25px">Unknown to the nurses, the Secretary, pulled 
strings to put a none-too subtle pressure on our officials from the POEA in 
Manila and the Consulate in New York apparently to make the complaining nurses 
back off from their case.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 25px">This conclusion is based on the acts of the 
Secretary that surfaced soon after the complaint of the nurses was filed against 
the Sentosa Recruitment Agency with the POEA in Manila. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 25px">In a rapid fire sequence, Secretary Defensor called 
up:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>1. POEA Administrator Baldoz of the POEA Adjudication Office who was with 
	Director Alejandro Padaen, in Manila, and</p>
	<p>2. Consul General Rebong of our New York Consulate. Ms. Rebong, as 
	recounted earlier, admitted that Secretary Defensor had telephoned her.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-indent: 25px">Although we did not hear what he had said to POEA 
Administrator Baldoz or to Consul General Rebong, it is easy to deduce from the 
circumstances that he, in effect, told the officials of the government concerned 
and the complaining nurses that they were better off to just take things in 
stride rather than to pursue their plaint before the bars of justice at home or 
in New York. I suggest that this is one instance where the truism that one's 
actions speak louder than words finds a concrete application.</p>
<p><i><u>Meddlesome secretary</u></i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 25px">Let me say that I was not at all disturbed by the 
action of the US senator who did what he could ethically do to advance the cause 
of his constituent. What flabbergasted me was the report that the officious 
secretary intervened in a pending case before the POEA and apparently caused the 
agency to subsequently reverse the order of suspension of the recruitment 
activities of Sentosa.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 25px">I cannot understand how in the world a department 
secretary could have the gall to act in a manner that in effect obstructs the 
interests of justice and causes prejudice to the interests of the people he is 
sworn to serve and do it right here in our country? That is something that we 
probably will never know under this government whose penchant for the 
suppression of information knows no bounds and whose desire to confuse the 
people equals the despotically deceptive record of the martial law regime. </p>
<p><i><u>For better view</u></i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 25px">To give us a better understanding of the issues 
presented here, let me recall the following:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>[a] On 24 May 2006 the POEA issued an order of preventive suspension 
	against the local agency, Sentosa Recruitment Agency in Manila;</p>
	<p>[b] On May 26, 2006, Sentosa filed an Ex-Parte Motion to Lift the 
	Suspension by Sentosa.</p>
	<p>[c] On 6 June 2006, Secretary Defensor called up POEA Administrator 
	Rosalinda Baldoz. POEA's Atty. Maribel Mariano-Beltran, the hearing officer 
	handling the Sentosa nurses' complaints and her superior, Atty. Alejandro 
	Padaen, the head of Adjudication Branch (the office in charge of this kind 
	of cases) were privy to the Secretary's call.</p>
	<p>[d] On 7 June 2006 Secretary Defensor at around noontime in New York had 
	a long talk on the phone with Consul General Rebong on the matter of the 
	complaints of the nurses and one physical therapist. </p>
	<p>[e] On 8 June 2006, two days Secretary Defensor's call to the POEA and 
	one day after his call to the New York Consul General, the POEA issued an 
	Order lifting the preventive suspension.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-indent: 25px">Considering the circumstances, Atty. Vinluan 
submits and I agree with him that the preventive suspension order on the 
recruitment activities of Sentosa in the country must have been lifted &quot;after 
Secretary Defensor called up POEA Administrator Baldoz and Consul General Rebong.&quot; 
As an aside, the possibility that the Secretary merely whispered sweet nothings 
into the ears of Ms. Baldoz and Ms. Rebong through the calls he made to them is 
rather far-fetched.</p>
<p><i><u>Unusual ruling</u></i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 25px">Now, Atty. Vinluan further opines that the lifting 
of the suspension of Sentosa Recruitment Agency was &quot;very unusual&quot;. It was the 
first time, he says, that he and POEA officials saw a preventive suspension 
order lifted barely two weeks from its issuance, and that, on the basis of an 
ex-parte motion. An ex-parte motion is one that is filed by a party (in this 
case by Sentosa) to a controversy without advising or giving a copy of it to the 
other party (in this case, the nurses). </p>
<p style="text-indent: 25px">To put it more bluntly, the Vinluan thesis suggests 
that the lifting could not have been done ex parte without the intervention of a 
powerful force (Defensor's) that the POEA could not resist.</p>
<p><i><u>Nurses' flight, our concern</u></i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 25px">That said, let me say that the plight of the 
complaining nurses remains our concern even as the majority of them are already 
in New York. I suppose our anxiety should probably even be more pronounced 
because their sad predicament betrays only the surface of the problems that 
beset many of our overseas workers in various degrees of intensity as they 
sojourn in various climes in search of a better life.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 25px">We hope, then, Mr. President, that with the 
assistance of the proper committees of the Senate and the Department of Foreign 
Affairs we can prod our Consulate in New York, the POEA, and other pertinent 
agencies of the government to provide justice to the nurses whose problems I 
have just outlined for our consideration. Right or wrong, our people in distress 
wherever they are need our help and as public officials, it is our duty to 
assist them. And perhaps, we can also craft legislation that will protect the 
welfare of our compatriots who unfortunately continue like the erratic Ponce de 
Leon to look for the elixir of life overseas ironically risking everything, life 
included.</p>
