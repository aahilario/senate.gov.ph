Press Release<br /><!-- NewsDate.start -->February 27, 2006<!-- NewsDate.end --><p style="text-align: center">
<span class="PRTitle"><!-- NewsTitle.start -->Senate condemns illegal acts under 
Proclamation 1017<!-- NewsTitle.end --></span></p>
<!-- NewsBody.start --><p>The alleged illegal acts and excesses committed by 
government forces such as the warrantless arrest of political opponents of 
President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, including a member of the House of 
Representatives, and the police takeover on the Daily Tribune newspaper were 
condemned in a resolution introduced in the Senate this afternoon.</p>
<p>In a resolution principally authored by Liberal Party leaders Senate 
President Franklin Drilon, Majority Leader Francis Pangilinan, Senators Mar 
Roxas, Rodolfo Biazon as well as independent Sen. Pia Cayetano, the Senate 
condemned the &quot;raid and exercise of control over print media, the warrantless 
arrest of several citizens including a member of the House of Representatives, 
and other similar acts carried out by the government pursuant to Proclamation 
No. 1017 issued by President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.&quot;</p>
<p>Drilon said several other senators, including those from the majority and the 
minority, have signified their intention to co-sponsor the resolution.</p>
<p>&quot;During these difficult and uncertain times, we must prevent the weakening of 
our democratic institutions and protect civil liberties as the cornerstone of 
our democracy,&quot; Drilon said.</p>
<p>The Senate President explained that as &quot;the elected representatives of the 
people, senators can not stand idle while overzealous functionaries of President 
Arroyo trample upon the bill of rights of our people under the guise of a real 
or an imagined national emergency.&quot;</p>
<p>In the resolution, the senators claimed that &quot;these acts carried out by the 
government pursuant to Proclamation No. 1017 on its face contravene the 
fundamental guarantees of the Constitution particularly the basic civil 
liberties enshrined therein and deserve outright condemnation.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Despite Malaca&ntilde;ang
s claim that Proclamation No. 1017 was a mere statement 
of fact, alarming acts have been carried out pursuant to said Proclamation, 
including: (1) all scheduled rallies, with or without permit, were cancelled; 
(2) some protesters, including UP Professor Randy David and Akbayan President 
Ronald Llamas, were apprehended for inciting to sedition and violation of the 
Public Assembly Act; (3) the National Telecommunications called a meeting of the 
members of the Kapisanan ng mga Broadcasters sa Pilipinas (KBP) and discussed 
the possible revocation of franchise or take-over of media companies that engage 
in biased reporting or publication of matters affecting national security; (4) a 
6:00 p.m. curfew was imposed on the press corps of Malaca&ntilde;ang
; (5) one major 
newspaper, The Daily Tribune, was raided and other major dailies were placed 
under surveillance; and (6) Party-List Congressman Crispin Beltran was arrested 
based on a warrant of arrest issued during Martial law, while other lawmakers 
are under threat of arrest; (7) attempted arrest of Bayan Muna partylist 
Representative Satur Ocampo; (8) retired Police Major General Ramon Montano was 
likewise arrested while other lawmakers and opposition leaders are under threat 
of arrest,&quot; the resolution said.</p>
<p>The resolution noted that on February 24, &quot;even before the issuance of 
Proclamation No. 1017, officials of Malaca&ntilde;ang
 categorically declared on 
national television that an attempt to overthrow the government has been 
successfully quelled and restrained.&quot;</p>
<p>The resolution cited that Article VI, Section 23 of the 1987 Constitution, 
&quot;allows the Congress to authorize, by law, the President to exercise certain 
powers during times of national emergency, for a limited period and subject to 
restrictions set by it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In accordance with Philippine constitutional practice and precedents, the 
declaration of a state of national emergency does not in any way suspend the 
Constitution and does not limit the civil liberties, basic human rights, freedom 
of the press and other fundamental rights enshrined therein,&quot; it added.</p>
<p>The resolution also noted that Congress, as a separate and independent body, 
&quot;has a constitutionally mandated duty to ensure that the demarcation defining 
the powers of the three branches of government are maintained and ensure, as 
part of the democratic checks and balance, that the acts of any other branch do 
not transgress.</p>
<p>The resolution noted that President Arroyos declaration of a State of 
National Emergency under Proclamation No. 1017 &quot;was a statement of fact and does 
not entail the Presidents exercise of additional powers.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Pursuant to Proclamation No. 1017, the President issued General Order No. 5 
calling &quot;upon the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) and the Philippine 
National Police (PNP) to prevent and suppress lawless violence in the country&quot; 
and directing &quot;the Chief of Staff of the AFP and Chief of the PNP to prevent and 
suppress acts of terrorism and lawless violence in the country,&quot; the resolution 
said.</p>
<p>&quot;The directive issued under General Order No. 5 gives the Armed Forces of the 
Philippines (AFP) and the Philippine national Police (PNP) and the PNP unbridled 
and broad discretion to carry out the supposed policy of Proclamation No. 1017, 
possibly opening boundless opportunities for abuse and violation of fundamental 
human rights,&quot; the Senate resolution pointed out.</p>
