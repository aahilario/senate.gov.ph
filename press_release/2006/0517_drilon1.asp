Press Release<br /><!-- NewsDate.start -->May 17, 2006<!-- NewsDate.end --><p>
<span class="PRTitle"><!-- NewsTitle.start -->Transcript of ANC interview with Senate 
President Franklin M. Drilon Tuesday night, May 16, 2006 with Pinky Webb<!-- NewsTitle.end --></span></p>
<!-- NewsBody.start --><p><i>Q: I was not surprised that you attended the LEDAC 
meeting because last year, you also attended that meeting the last time</i></p>

<p>SPFMD: That's right. It was September last year when the last LEDAC meeting 
was held. I was there. It is my duty as President of the Senate. By law, we are 
designated as members of the LEDAC. We were there last year. We were there this 
morning.</p>

<p><i>Q: There were supporters and critics of GMA in the LEDAC, didn't you feel 
that there could have been some softening on any side there?</i></p>

<p>SPFMD: At least, there was openness, there was a dialogue. It doesn't mean 
though, that there were already changes in position. The proposal was that the 
two committee chairs, Sen. Gordon and Cong. Jaraula, together with the members 
of their committee, sit down and discuss and see if there was any point we can 
agree on. We are reasonable men; we said having a dialogue between two committee 
of both houses is not unusual. It is done in ordinary course of legislation. 
Certainly, a dialogue between Sen. Gordon and Cong. Jaraula on the Con-Ass is 
not objectionable. The Senate maintains its position as we have approved in 
Resolution No. 75, 22 of us, out of 23, excluding Sen. Magsaysay, took the 
position that in any Constituent Assembly, the Senate must vote separately. This 
is the position of the Senate as an institution.</p>

<p><i>Q: Sen. Magsaysay did not sign that because he was on leave?</i></p>

<p>SPFMD: Correct. I'm certain, if given the opportunity, he would sign. 
Therefore, it would be unanimous Senate taking that position. We have another 
resolution; it's Resolution No. 77, which stated that it is the sense of the 
Senate that the people's initiative is patently illegal for lack of any legal 
basis and the fact that what is being proposed, a change in government, is a 
revision of the Constitution, which cannot be done through a people's 
initiative. Again, this is a Senate resolution adopted by the body. It is not 
only the view of the individual members, but the view of the entire Senate as an 
institution. Only Sen. Angara and Sen. Lapid did not sign that resolution.</p>

<p><i>Q: This means, though, that the senators are never against charter change?</i></p>

<p>SPFMD: Some senators, one or two or three, who may maintain that 'no, we do 
not touch the charter.' But on various levels, senators by and large, are 
amenable to looking at certain provisions of the Constitution. It is in the 
manner of the amendment that very strong disagreements came about. That is why 
we have these two resolutions.</p>

<p><i>Q: You were more inclined to a Constitutional Convention</i></p>

<p>SPFMD: That's a correct recollection. That is what I said. That is what I 
continue to believe in. But we are a collegial body. Therefore, at a certain 
point in time, we will be voting on this. Incidentally, these matters are 
pending before the committee of Sen. Gordon. We respect the committee system in 
the Senate. There were suggestions at the LEDAC meeting today that this proposed 
dialogue be undertaken by the leadership of both the Senate and the House. We 
said no, we respect our committee system. Sen. Gordon will lead our Senate 
contingent and Cong. Jaraula should lead the House contingent. And that was 
followed.</p>

<p><i>Q: Do you think the plan to revise the charter through Constitutional 
Convention may be impossible at this point?</i></p>

<p>SPFMD: Again, I don't want to preempt how our committee will decide. As I 
said, there are a number of us who believe that a Constitutional Convention is 
the proper mode. But it's difficult to say. But going back to the LEDAC, what I 
noticed is that it would appear that the President is now inclined to adopt the 
Con-Ass as the mode of trying to amend the Constitution. I think the matter of 
the people's initiative, which is really problematic, is being abandoned by 
Malaca&ntilde;ang
. This is a conclusion that I can draw from the meeting this morning. 
Because the President didn't even mention about the people's initiative. Because 
of the problem; you have no enabling law. A change in the form of government is 
clearly a revision, which is not proper in a people's initiative. Only an 
amendment. I can see that they have some problems in gathering three percent 
from all congressional districts. Maybe because of these problems, I am of the 
view that the President is inclined to abandon the cha cha-people's initiative 
train. Mind you, a very close adviser of the President gave me this conclusion 
two or three weeks ago and said the President may no longer push for the 
people's initiative. I think today's proceedings at the LEDAC, more or less 
validates that observation. Therefore, some local mayors and national officials 
who spent public funds for the people's initiative may have to start thinking of 
how they will liquidate these funds.</p>

<p><i>Q: Senators are against people's initiative</i></p>

<p>SPFMD: In the same way that we have taken the position that any Constituent 
Assembly which is done solely by the House will be opposed vehemently by the 
Senate as an institution.</p>

<p><i>Q: 23 of you said, 'no way to people's initiative,' 22 of you said, 
'alright, we can do Constituent Assembly but we need to vote separately.' That 
is why Con-Ass was put forward on the table</i></p>

<p>SPFMD: These are conclusions that we draw from the events. It's speculative 
at this point. I draw my own conclusion. It may or may not be true but that is 
how I read the situation this morning.</p>

<p><i>Q: There is a concurrent resolution convening Congress into a Constituent 
Assembly, should the talks begin from there?</i></p>

<p>SPFMD: Logically the talks will begin from there. The House passed this late 
last year. It was referred to the Senate for our concurrence. This indicates 
that the House recognizes that indeed, the Senate would have to act on this as a 
body. Therefore, the process that they have followed or intend to follow until 
this morning of securing the signatures of 195 congressmen in total disregard of 
the Senate would have no legal basis.</p>

<p><i>Q: There was no timetable set for the meeting of the two committees?</i></p>

<p>SPFMD: We left it to the committees. As Cong. Villafuerte and Butch Aquino 
said, let's see what it is doable. We were open to that dialogue. We will ask 
Senator Gordon to sit down with them and craft a committee report when your 
committee feels it's proper and submit it to the Senate for our concurrence.</p>

<p><i>Q: Cong. Cagas said one of the things that came out in the LEDAC meeting 
was this: there were 33 bills of national importance that was passed by the 
lower house but the senators have not acted upon</i></p>

<p>SPFMD: Firstly, on the local bills, these bills would sometimes like to 
change the names of the road, or convert a local road into a national road. 
Today we received 59 bills which would convert local high schools into national 
high schools and put the budget in the national budget. Point number one, if 
such a local bill would require Senate concurrence, certainly, a more important 
measure like amending the Constitution would certainly have more reason to 
require the Senate's concurrence. Number 2, these local bills require funding. 
Last year, the estimate is that there are about P650 billion in unfunded laws. 
You add to this all of these conversion of high schools into national high 
schools, which would put the funding in the national budget. Then, where will we 
get the funding? We have to ask the Department of Education where they propose 
to secure the funding. Certainly, they could not point to any.</p>

<p><i>Q: He said 33 bills of national importance, they always hit the senators 
with that.</i></p>

<p>SPFMD: This is part of the choir of Senate bashers orchestrated somewhere in 
the Pasig river. Today, Secretary Neri made a rosy presentation of the economy. 
The economy could not have been rosy without the bills we have passed in 
Congress, the bills which improves the tax collection, the value added tax, the 
sin taxes, the tax on luxury vehicles the attrition law, the special purpose 
assets vehicle, etc. Yes, there are still 33 bills of national application. 
During our session yesterday in the Senate, in our caucus, we identified, other 
than the budget, 6 or 7 other measures which we thought is worth considering 
before the session is over. Many of the bills, a number of them require funding, 
and this is of which the reason why we are adamant in looking at it. Again, even 
if it involves funding, there could be differences in policy. This is precisely 
the reason for a bicameral congress. We debate on policy; it doesn't mean if it 
is passed by one house then it should be passed by the other, otherwise what do 
we have a bicameral system for? The check and balance is the essence of a 
bicameral system.</p>

<p><i>Q: Does it matter that they say they you don't pass these bills and you're 
all concerned about inquiries in aid of legislation?</i></p>

<p>SPFMD: First, it is not just we are involve in inquiries in aid of 
legislation because this is part of the function in a working democracy, the 
check and balance, the inquiry into what we perceive as anomalies in government. 
I would repeat: if you believe the presentation of Sec. Neri in the LEDAC 
meeting today, the economy is working well, there seems to be nothing wrong with 
this government and so I do not know if we need that many legislation that are 
being mentioned. Critical last year was the value added tax because of the 
budget deficit and that is the single most important piece of legislation that 
we have a considered and it caused a reduction in the budget deficit by a very 
substantial amount and a number of other measures I have mentioned earlier.</p>

<p><i>Q: What is the most important for the Senate in the next 11 session days 
that you have before you adjourn sine die on June 8?</i></p>

<p>SPFMD: First, we will pass the 2006 budget. In the caucus yesterday of the 
senators, we agreed to start the debate on Monday, May 22. We will finish the 
budget in the Senate on May 26. This budget stayed in the House for nine months 
and they approved exactly the same budget as presented to the body. We agreed to 
pass the credit information bureau which would allow access to credit 
information in order to aid in the transactions in our financial system. We also 
agreed to amendments to EPIRA or the Electric Power Industry Reform Act is in 
order; the matter of the biofuels which will provide incentive to the 
development of indigenous sources of energy because of the spiraling cost of 
fuel in the world today; the anti terror bill is being worked upon; the 
automation of the election which has been snagged because of the implementation 
problems as we all know, the present law would not be technology neutral that is 
why we are trying to amend it under the sponsorship of Sen. Gordon; the 
simplified net income tax, which would provide income tax relief to our minimum 
wage workers.</p>

<p><i>Q: You were inclined to pass the P1.053 T budget?</i></p>

<p>SPFMD: The total budget is P1.053 T. There are a number of items there which 
has raised eyebrows on the part of the senators. For example, there is the Kilos 
Asenso, a P5 billion one-line item in the budget which we view as a pork barrel 
on the part of the President; the Kalayaan fund, another P3 B. That's a total of 
P8B. There is another P10 B for, I think, separation of benefits for an intended 
reorganization of government which apparently would not happen this year. All of 
these we will scrutinize carefully. That is why in the DOTC suddenly we 
discovered that they were given a couple of billion pesos to spend and they 
suddenly had all kinds of repairs and all kinds of airports. All of these, we 
discovered these in the course of our hearings of the Committee of the Whole and 
that is what Sen. Gordon is referring to.</p>

<p><i>Q: I understand--during the deliberations at the Lower House, you were 
already also looking into the budget independently.</i></p>

<p>SPFMD: That's right. In fact, one of the objectives of the Senate in this 
budget is to further reduce the deficit that we have suffered for a number of 
years. In the presentation of Romulo Neri today, he was encouraging that this 
deficit be reduced and certain reduction on the expenditure side which again 
reduce the deficit and have a more robust economy.</p>

<p><i>Q: Villar needs thirteen votes. He said I only need 11 more because I have 
Senate President Drilon's signature and mine.</i></p>

<p>SPFMD: I confirm that. I said I will honor our commitment. I will sign the 
resolution that will be passed around. Manny and I will be working on our 
colleagues. At this point, we leave it at that because the agreement is on July. 
By the way, it is a personal commitment on my part. Therefore, the criticisms 
that we have made a deal on a public office is not totally accurate because 
obviously it needs the support of 13 senators.</p>

<p><i>Q: Do you think anybody else would be supporting Sen. Santiago's 
statements?</i></p>

<p>SPFMD: Miriam said if the Supreme Court will sustain the question of the 
people's initiative or the Con-Ass being implemented in a manner that it is 
implemented now, and No. 2, of course if the people will approve the same in a 
plebiscite. I don't think that these can happen in July. We do not know how the 
Supreme Court will react to these cases, to these questions. We do not how the 
people would react. I think it is premature at this point. (end)</p>
