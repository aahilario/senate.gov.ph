Press Release<br /><!-- NewsDate.start -->March 29, 2006<!-- NewsDate.end --><p style="text-align: left">
<span class="PRTitle"><!-- NewsTitle.start -->Transcript of Senate President Franklin 
M. Drilons press conference<!-- NewsTitle.end --></span></p>
<!-- NewsBody.start --><p align="justify"><i>Q: Abalos is insisting that they 
will go on with the verification of signatures</i></p>
<p align="justify">SPFMD: The Comelec will be verifying these signatures and use 
government resources at their own risk. Remember that in the case of Mega 
Pacific case, because of the failure of the Ombudsman to follow the directive of 
the Supreme Court on the prosecution of those responsible for the Mega Pacific 
scam, the Ombudsman was cited for contempt by the petitioners. The matter is now 
pending before the court. How the Supreme Court will handle this motion to cite 
in contempt the Ombudsman will be controlling insofar as the possible action 
that any party can take on any defiance that the Comelec may commit on the PIRMA 
case that the court decided in 1997. In the case of Miriam Defensor Santiago vs. 
Comelec, the Supreme Court expressly ruled that the Comelec is permanently 
prevented or enjoined from entertaining any petition on peoples initiative 
until a law is passed. No law has been passed. Therefore, it is at their own 
risk that they defy this directive of the Supreme Court. Chairman Abalos being a 
lawyer, and all the election registrars all over the country to participate in 
this gathering of signatures and in verifying these signatures will be doing so 
at their own risk of being cited for contempt before the Supreme Court for 
defying a clear directive of the court prohibiting them from entertaining these 
petitions.</p>
<p align="justify"><i>Q: An order should be given to provincial registrars to 
desist and not to entertain this petition?</i></p>
<p align="justify">SPFMD: The election registrars all over the country are 
well-advised not to entertain these petitions as the Supreme Court has 
permanently enjoined the Comelec from entertaining these petitions. I am warning 
these election registrars: You will be entertaining these petitions as election 
registrars at your own risk.</p>
<p align="justify"><i>Q: Ang explanation ng Comelec is that verifying the 
signatures is just part of the process, hindi iyon mismo ang petition</i></p>
<p align="justify">SPFMD: At the appropriate time, they may have to present that 
argument before the Supreme Court. I believe otherwise.</p>
<p align="justify"><i>Q: The Santiago vs. Comelec case was not unanimousthe 
court may reverse the ruling</i></p>
<p align="justify">SPFMD: The decision was made by the court en banc. Except for 
two dissenting opinions, all the justices then concurred with the decision. Of 
course, its a matter for the Supreme Court to decide. But until the Supreme 
Court decides otherwise, the injunction stays. The Comelec should follow this 
injunction. The Comelec decision is part of the law of the land. The decisions 
of the Supreme Court will be no different from a law passed by Congress insofar 
as its force or effectivity is concerned.</p>
<p align="justify"><i>Q: The CA passed a resolution on Cabinet secretaries who 
failed to comply with documentary requirements</i></p>
<p align="justify">SPFMD: The Commission on Appointments today passed a 
resolution citing the rules of the Commission which says that the nominees and 
the appointees should submit to the Commission all the documentary requirements. 
Otherwise, they stand the risk of their appointments being rejected. And if the 
appointment is rejected by the Commission, then they can no longer be 
re-appointed. Once they are rejected, they can no longer be re-appointed as 
distinguished from being simply bypassed. All the Cabinet secretaries who have 
failed to comply with this requirement were duly notified. If at the deadline 
they have not submitted these requirements, then the Commission has the 
discretion under our rules to reject. Whether or not the Commission will reject 
depends on the judgment of the Commission.</p>
<p align="justify"><i>Q: Is it a surprise that Mayuga is being confirmed today 
despite a warning from the Senate that they will hold his confirmation if he 
does not reveal the Mayuga report?</i></p>
<p align="justify">SPFMD: The Commission was convinced that it is out of Vice 
Admiral Mayugas hands. He has submitted the report. He has followed the chain 
of command as it should be. He submitted the report to the chief of staff. The 
Chief of Staff has submitted it to the Secretary of the Department of National 
Defense for transmittal to the President. So insofar as Vice Admiral Mayuga is 
concerned, he has complied with his duty. The Commission was convinced that he 
should not be faulted for the non-release to the public of this report. I call 
on the Secretary of National Defense and the President to release this report to 
the public.</p>
<p align="justify"><i>Q: How soon?</i></p>
<p align="justify">SPFMD: As soon as possible.</p>
<p align="justify"><i>Q: Ano ang deadline for the Cabinet secretaries to submit 
the requirement?</i></p>
<p align="justify">SPFMD: They are given 15 days from receipt. They received it 
on March 21. Effectively, we will take this up when we come back after our 
Lenten break. Thats the reality.</p>
<p align="justify"><i>Q: On usurpation of public function</i></p>
<p align="justify">SPFMD: That was in response to the question what is the 
effect of a rejection? The effect of a rejection is they cannot be 
re-appointed. And if they continue to perform their function, there can be 
usurpation of public function. But only at that point kapag na-reject na. (end)</p>
