<span class="PRTitle"><!-- NewsTitle.start -->Sponsorship speech of Sen. Chiz Escudero<!-- NewsTitle.end --></span>
</p>
<!-- NewsBody.start --><p style="text-align: justify">Mr. President, Distinguished Colleagues, Good afternoon.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">I rise to sponsor the national budget for fiscal year 2014 in a time of turmoil, be it natural or man-made.  It seems that the nation was just recovering from the mayhem caused by the MNLF-instigated violence in Zamboanga City when a magnitude 7.2 temblor shook Bohol and its surrounding environs, with both events costing  the nation dearly in terms of human lives lost and damage to property.  And as if nature's wrath is yet to be appeased, Super typhoon Yolanda came barrelling past our country with its killer winds levelling whole islands and communities in the Visayas, leaving in its wake a wide swathe of destruction and tragic loss of lives unprecedented in recent history. In the same breath, the nation's administrative institutions are similarly under siege, with the heated pork barrel controversy hogging newspaper headlines, emitting the foul stench of corruption permeating the various echelons of government.  From the legislative branch all the way to the cavernous halls of Malaca&ntilde;ang, the political turmoil spawned by the pork barrel scandal -- be it the infamous Priority Assistance Development Fund a.k.a. PDAF or the Disbursement Acceleration Program a.k.a. DAP -- spurred tens of thousands of concerned citizens to march and demand, in outrage, no less than the total abolition of pork barrel in the 2014 national budget.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Article VI, Sec. 29 of the Philippine Constitution mandates that "No money shall be paid by the Treasury except in pursuance of an appropriation made by law.   Congress, therefore, holds the power of the purse and therefore, the fuel for the entire government machinery. The authority given to the executive branch to disburse public funds is merely a delegated power granted to it by Congress.   And enact a national budget we must, especially in this time of turmoil, if the engine of government is to continue humming every single day, even amid the cacophony of voices reflecting political discord.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Key Reforms</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">It seems a pity, Mr. President, that the laudable key reform measures instituted in the proposed 2014 national budget were overshadowed by today's broiling pork controversy that has discredited the entire budget process.  Foremost among these reforms is the concept of Performance-Informed Budgeting that has given an innovatively new face to today's budget documents, presenting not just the pesos but more importantly, the outcomes, outputs and performance targets of government agencies for the succeeding year.   In addition, the newly-instituted Program Budgeting Approach now allows for better collaboration among government agencies through convergence of efforts and resources along priority programs of the government as envisioned under the Social Contract.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">One other innovative key reform instituted is the movement towards a "Budget-as-Release Document" in 2014.  Simply put, the Department of Budget and Management declares that "the budgets of agencies - except those to be contained in a negative list - are considered released to them as soon as the National Budget takes effect.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">To make this possible, Mr. President, the 2014 budget is, to date, the most detailed budget proposal in our country's history 
...almost all are "line items" to include personal services, maintenance and other operating expenses, and capital outlays, so that transparency is very high.  There would be no need any more for the infamous Special Allotment Release Order or SARO that authorizes a government agency to incur obligations not exceeding a given amount during the specified period.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">In keeping with the government's drive towards inclusive development, the 2014 budget also allowed the citizens' active participation in the crafting of the people's budget.  In particular, Budget Partnership Agreements were drafted between agencies and civil society organizations, while Bottom-Up Budgeting allowed the participation of local government and communities in the budget process.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The Proposed FY 2014 National Budget</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Mr. President, the proposed national budget for fiscal year 2014 amounts to P2.268 trillion, reflecting a nominal increase of P262.10 billion or 13.07 per cent over the current year's P2.006 trillion budget.  Expenditures shall be supported by projected revenues of P2.018 trillion representing a revenue effort of 15.1 per cent of our Gross Domestic Product.  Tax Revenues, in particular, will account for P1.879 trillion in FY 2014 or a tax effort of 14.1 per cent while Non-Tax Revenues will amount to P136.13 billion.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">In terms of appropriation source, New General Appropriations of P1.612 trillion will constitute the bulk while Automatic Appropriations of P796.029 billion will include the Internal Revenue Allotment, various Special Accounts, along with debt service, specifically interest payments.    The biggest slice of the budget pie will be consumed by Social Services at 37 percent, followed by Economic Services at 26 per cent.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">In the light of the string of destructive calamities that descend upon the Philippines every year, it is worthy of note that the Alternative Budget Initiative - Environment Cluster (ABI-ENVI) and La Liga Policy Institute has tagged budgets for Climate Change Adaptation and Disaster Risk Reduction that are embedded within the budgets of several departments.  ABI reported that out of these tagged budgets amounting to P73,000,248,000 in the 2014 National Expenditure Program, 47% will go to flood control projects; 14% to housing program for Informal Settler Families (ISF) in danger zones in the NCR;  16% to the Quick Response Funds (QRF) in the budgets of the DSWD, DA, DepEd, DND-OCD and DPWH and the Calamity Fund under the Office of the President;  and 23% to other adaptation and DRRM related projects including multi-hazard and early warning systems, vulnerability and adaptation assessment, adaptation in agriculture and international commitments funds.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The House-approved General Appropriations Bill</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">As approved by the House of Representatives, the General Appropriations Bill or GAB is P98 million lower than the President's proposed budget for 2014.  In particular, New Appropriations for the succeeding fiscal year amounts to a lower P1,611.776 billion as approved by the House, in contrast to the President's proposal of P1,611.874 billion.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">With the total Unprogrammed Fund and Automatic Appropriations remaining unchanged vis-a-vis the President's Budget proposal, the 2014 Obligation budget recommended by the House amounts to P2,267.902 billion.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">A major portion of the amendments contained in the GAB were part of the Errata on the National Expenditure Program that were submitted by the Department of Budget and Management, and are mostly internal realignments within agencies or departments.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Topping the list of controversial amendments in the GAB is the deletion, in toto, of the Priority Development Assistance Fund or PDAF, which the House realigned to various agencies, along with the P200 million of priority programs and projects deleted from the budget of the Office of the Vice President.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">These amounts were in turn transferred to the Department of Health for assistance to indigent patients, the Department of Labor and Employment for employment facilitation and capacity building, the Department of Social Welfare and Development in support of service to individuals and families in especially difficult circumstances, the Department of Public Works and Highways for additional regional and local infrastructure projects, and the Commission on Higher Education for additional assistance, incentives, scholarship and grants.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Senate Amendments</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Your Committee on Finance, Mr. President, diligently conducted daily budget hearings from August to October, in addition to various meetings with the agencies' technical staff as the need arose.  After wrapping up these hearings, the committee now presents the following amendments for the chamber's consideration and approval.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">As proposed by your Committee on Finance, Mr. President, Total New Appropriations will amount to P1,608.576 Billion, a net cut of P3.2 Billion from the House-approved P1,611.776 Billion.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">This net cut, Mr. President, represents the foregone pork barrel of a total of 15 senators and the Vice President who have decided to heed the clamour of the people to totally renounce their P200 million PDAF allocation in the 2014 General Appropriations Act.  The P3.2 billion cut was deducted from the four agencies where the House of Representatives decided to temporarily "park" the PDAF allocation of the senators namely the Commission on Higher Education, the Department of Health, the Department of Labor and Employment, and the Department of Social Welfare and Development.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">With Automatic Appropriations remaining at P796.029 billion and  Unprogrammed Fund at P139.904 billion, the 2014 Obligation budget recommended by your committee now amounts to P2,264.702 Billion.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The major increases, Mr. President, consist of the following:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify" class="style1">1. P5.5 billion additional allocation for the Calamity Fund consisting of Aid, Relief and Rehabilitation Services to communities/areas affected by calamities including Training of Personnel and other Pre-disaster Activities, as well as Repair and Reconstruction of Permanent Structures including Capital Expenditures for Pre-disaster Operations, Rehabilitation and Other Related Activities. Pursuant to RA 10121, we are also recommending the renaming of the Calamity Fund to the National Disaster Risk Reduction Management Fund; </p>
<p style="text-align: justify" class="style1">2. P250 Million in Quick Response Funds for the Department of Health, particularly for the deployment of medical teams, procurement of commodities, and financial assistance to hospitals; and P50 Million for Medical Equipment, or a total of P300 Million; </p>
<p style="text-align: justify" class="style1">3. P300 Million in Quick Respond Funds for the Department of Transportation and Communications to enable the immediate rehabilitation of crucial transportation facilities necessary to normalized the situation and living conditions of the people in disaster stricken areas; </p>
<p style="text-align: justify" class="style1">4. P100 Million for the Department of Justice's JUSIP-Construction, Repair and Rehabilitation of Building; </p>
<p style="text-align: justify" class="style1">5. P500 Million for the Initial Construction of a New Building for the Securities and Exchange Commission; </p>
<p style="text-align: justify" class="style1">6. P50 Million for the Implementation of Clean Air Regulations under the DENR-Environmental Management Bureau; </p>
<p style="text-align: justify" class="style1">7. P20 Million for Climate Change Adaptation works for the Department of Agriculture;  </p>
<p style="text-align: justify" class="style1">8. Realignment of P2.5 Billion from lump-sum appropriations for scholarship programs to the budget of the 112 State Universities and Colleges which was done in consultation with the Commission on Higher Education.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">One other major amendment proposed by your Committee on Finance, Mr. President, is the creation of a new special purpose fund, the P20 Billion Disaster Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Fund, to be used for the rehabilitation, repair and reconstruction works and activities of areas affected by the typhoons Yolanda, Santi, and Labuyo, as well as the recent 7.2 magnitude tectonic earthquake.  Its funds shall be released directly to the implementing agencies and/or local government units concerned and shall be used for repair and rehabilitation of the following:  irrigation systems; school buildings; electrification infrastructure; academic building of state universities and colleges; historical sites;  roads, bridges, government buildings and other infrastructure; airports and ports; and local infrastructure.  It shall also be used for the construction of housing units, purchase of emergency relocation/structures, core shelter program, and the cash for work livelihood program.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">With respect to the Special / General Provisions, Mr. President, the more significant amendments consist of the following:</p>

We're no Hercules, Mr. President, but in this time of national calamity and amid the unspeakable grief and despair of our countrymen who tragically lost their entire homes and loved ones to nature's fury, the least we can do is to rise above pork-tainted political bickerings and instead start rolling up our sleeves and giving our countrymen the Senate that they, in earnest, truly deserve.</p>
