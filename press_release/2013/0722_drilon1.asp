<p style="text-align: justify">My esteemed colleagues.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">I stand before you, honored and humbled by your  trust and confidence in me. It is indeed a great privilege to  lead, for the fourth time, this august chamber.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Today, the Senate is making history in the 16th  Congress. Half of its members are below 50. A quarter  of the members are ladies. This is the first time that this  extraordinary membership happened since the Senate's  creation. This ensures that the issues and concerns of  women, and of the younger generation, will be given more  focus and consideration.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The interesting blend of personalities, professional  backgrounds and affiliations, is a positive sign towards  crafting laws that would address the structural deficiencies  of our economy, the weaknesses of our political system  and the ills of our society. We should expect healthy,  stimulating and enriching debates in the days ahead, as  we buckle down to work and look into different issues from  different perspectives.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">When I look at our new Senators, I see idealism  etched all over their youthful faces. I encourage our young  colleagues to bring in fresh ideas to the floor, and never  hesitate to seek counsel from senior members.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">My dear colleagues. As we start our work today,  Juan dela Cruz will ask us: "What is the relevance of  the Senate in my life?" Ang tanong ng taumbayan:  "Ano ba ang kinalaman ng Senado sa aking buhay?"</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The question speaks volumes about the people's  sentiments. Nakalulungkot isipin na para sa karamihan  ng ating mga kababayan, ang Senado ay isang debating  club lamang, na ang Senado ay para lamang sa mga  mayayaman at makapangyarihan na hindi batid ang  tunay na pangangailangan ng mga mahihirap.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">It saddens me that ordinary folks think that the  Senate is a debating club, which only serves the wealthy,  educated and powerful class, and is not mindful of the  economic difficulties they are facing. Let us make it  clear that we debate because it is only through a vibrant  exchange of ideas that we can craft the best laws for  economic development and social protection that would  spur massive job creation. Ladies and gentlemen of the  Senate, now, more than ever, we have to collectively work  harder to craft laws that would have a positive impact on  the lives of our people.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Ang kailangan natin ngayon ay isang Senadong  nakikinig at tumutugon sa pulso ng mga mamamayan,  lalo na ng mga mahihirap at mga maralita.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">We must be a sensitive and responsive Senate. A  Senate that feels the pulse of the people. A Senate that is  tireless in pursuing reforms to propel our beloved country  to greater economic, political and social heights.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">But more important, we should be a critical thinking  Senate. Debates are good; and we encourage that because  the well-crafted laws are the ones that have been debated  lengthily and passionately.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">In the past three years, the Philippines emerged  from being the sick man of Asia, to being a darling of the  international finance community. But we have to make the  glowing growth figures, investment grade status and the  rosy economic picture more meaningful to every Filipino  man, woman and child.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">We rejoice at the improved investor confidence  because of the government's seriousness in pursuing  good governance. However, we must continue to explore  ways to enable the poorest of the poor see a remarkable  improvement in their lives.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">We must address the cold hard facts of a non- inclusive growth. Notwithstanding the great strides  we have made, particularly on our economy, the fact  remains that as of April 2013, the unemployment rate is  7.5%, while underemployment is 19.2%. The agricultural  sector employs more than a third of our labor force, yet  agricultural workers are among the lowest paid. Thus, the  non-inclusive growth.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">During the 15th Congress, we have passed the Sin Tax  Law which is expected to generate an additional P248.5  billion in revenues in the first five years from 2013 to 2017,  of which P34 billion is expected to be realized in 2013.  The incremental revenues will be earmarked for health  programs that will include enrolling the poor into the  universal healthcare program and upgrading of hospitals  and other healthcare facilities. With that, Juan de la Cruz  can look forward to quality medical and health care.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Moreover, we continued and even increased the budget  for the Conditional Cash Transfer Program to help 3.8  million poor households improve their health, nutrition  and education especially of children aged 0-14. The 2013  national budget prioritizes public service, job generation,  education and health.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">For the past three years, we passed the national  budget on time, thus enabling the timely construction of  much needed school buildings and infrastructure support.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">However, we all know that we need to do more. While  we are proud of what we have done for the poorest of the  poor during the past Congress, we are also aware that we  are racing against time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">We start by building on our gains. We may have  achieved so much in three years, but there is more we  can do. We must improve the economic landscape to spur  investments and set off massive job creation. We must  strengthen the manufacturing and agriculture sectors,  which employ most of the people in the lower rung of the  economic ladder. Let us walk a mile more, and further  stimulate the economy to generate employment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">We must address the major impediments to economic  development, such as the high cost of energy. The constant  power interruptions, especially in Mindanao, affect our  chances of attracting much-needed investments. We all  know that economic development is a potent antidote to  the poverty-induced bloody conflicts in the South.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">We must ensure that our poverty reduction strategy  is anchored on the principles of social protection and  economic inclusion, human rights, transparency and  accountability, environmental protection. Moreover, we  must not discount the pressing challenges of our time  such as climate change and natural disasters, economic  and financial crises in the regional and global level.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">We will recommend to our colleagues in the Senate as  our legislative agenda the following important measures  meant to create an environment that will further strengthen  our economic fundamentals and boost employment.  These include the following: The Rationalization of Fiscal  Incentives; The Rationalization of the Mining Fiscal  Regime; Amendments to the Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT)  Law; The Tax Incentives Monitoring and Transparency Act  (TIMTA); and The Removal of Investment Restrictions in  Specific Laws cited in the Foreign Investment Negative List  (FINL).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Also on the list of recommended priority measures  are the following: The Amendments to the Charter of the  Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas; and enacting the National  Land Use Act.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Faster disposition of cases in our courts is key to  restoring our people's confidence in our justice system. It  will also underscore our seriousness in pursuing the path  of good governance. Amending the Ombudsman Act and  the Sandiganbayan Law to ensure the speedy resolution  of 2,600 cases currently pending with the anti-graft court  will be a good start.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">We support the peace process in Mindanao. Once the  peace agreement is signed with the MILF, we will amend  the Organic Act, to institute the necessary reforms called  for in the Agreement.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">My esteemed colleagues. Let us not forget that this is  the Senate of the Filipino people. The welfare and general  well-being of our people are our priority. We must work  harder to provide them with opportunities and choices to  enable them to live with dignity and honor.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">As lawmakers and representatives of our people,  we must ensure that the Philippine story is the story of  inclusive and sustainable development, and lasting peace.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Walang Pilipino ang maiiwan. Ang bawat isang  Pilipino, anuman ang estado sa buhay, ay mararamdaman  ang makabuluhang pagbabago at pag-unlad sa kanilang  buhay.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">That no Filipino will be left behind. That each man  and woman on the street, regardless of economic status,  social background, religion and affiliation will experience  a remarkable improvement in his/her life. And that the  poorest and marginalized will be able to live self-sufficient  and productive lives.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Finally, we recognize that the events in the past  months have affected the perception of the people on the  Senate. The institution has been affected. It thus becomes  our individual and collective obligation to bring back  the confidence of the people into this vital institution of  democracy. And the only way to do this is to work harder  and to show to our people that we deserve their mandate  and trust.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Now, more than ever, we must transcend political  differences and focus on these challenges. We must think  of innovations and solutions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">My dear colleagues. Let us do our share in nation  building. Our people expect more from us. Let us not fail  them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Thank you very much. God bless the Senate. God bless  the Philippines. God bless the Filipinos. Mabuhay tayong  lahat!</p>
