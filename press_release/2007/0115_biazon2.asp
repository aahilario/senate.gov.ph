Press Release<br /><!-- NewsDate.start -->January 15, 2007<!-- NewsDate.end --><p>
<span class="PRTitle"><!-- NewsTitle.start -->Transcript of Sen. Rodolfo G. Biazon's press conference<!-- NewsTitle.end --></span></p>
<!-- NewsBody.start --><p style="text-align: justify"><i>On appointment of Davide to the United Nations</i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">I would say that the appointment is ad interim, meaning he can already perform the functions, this happened to me after my retirement from the AFP when I was nominated 2x by former Pres Cory Aquino to be ambassador to Russia but I was rejected 2x by the Commission on Appointment, and at the second appointment as a matter of fact,  there was issued agreement by the Russian govt, meaning I was accepted and I could already perform my duties, but I refused to go to Moscow without the confirmation and true enough I was rejected by the Commission on Appointment and probably because I got mad I ran for the Senate, and that is why I am here.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">In the case of Davide, he can perform, he can go there, IF there is a need for an agreement from the UN for his posting, I do not know if there is such a requirement. I think we should avoid what happened to Ambassador Bolton of the USA, he was not confirmed and yet he occupied his post in the UN without confirmation, and now that the Democrats won in the Legislature, there is a great possibility that He would not be confirmed. That is why I think he had to resign and another one had to be appointed by Pres Bush..I hope this does not happen to our Ambassador appointee because we might have a new composition of the 14th Congress.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The sessions will end June and there might not be enough time for the confirmation of Justice Davide to the UN post, THIS WOULD BE A DECISION OF THE CHIEF JUSTICE.. I HOPE WHAT HAPPENED TO BOLTON WOULD NOT HAPPEN TO DAVIDE. If Davide is not confirmed by the CA, what kind of presentation will you be able to provide being a representative of our country to the UN..this will decrease his effectiveness </p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><i>Series of Suspensions, Disqualifications of Local Officials</i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">There is a great possibility that the decisions were based on proper procedure and according to the law, but the timing and political situation renders these decisions suspect Like the reported dismissals of Mayor Peewee of Pasay and MakatiI would leave these to the court.. let the court explain especially the more prominent figures slapped suspension or dismissal orders or those threatened with cases being filed like Mayor Binay who is a prominent Opposition Binay..</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Samantalang may iba may mas maraming kase, pero kilalang kaalyado n gating Pangulo o Adminsitration, hindi nakakasuhan ng ganun.. The timing is wrong because of the upcoming May 2007 elections, siguro walang kwention diyan, kung lahat  kinasuhan na  kung sa mga kaalyado ng Pangulo ganun din  ang ginawa</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><i>On Chavit for Senator</i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">This is a free country anybody can run for whatever position they fancy and it is the right of the political parties to put up their candidates..the question is.. does the Administration already lack candidates to compose the national slate for the Senate?..Mukhang wala yatang gusto tumakbo sa ilalim ng Administration..I think that for anyone in the Administration slate to have a chance to win in the Senate, they must first project to the public that they are distancing from the Admistration or that they are showing they can oppose some policies by the Administration.. you can detect this being exhibited by some of those being reported to run under the Administration slate ogf the Senate  mukhang lumalaban ng konti.. If Gov Singson wants to run, that is his right, it is also the right of the political party to draft anyone, if they can not produce a credible slate, kahit sino pwede na nila ilagay dun..anyway it is the people rendering the judgement on anyone running the Senate.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><i>Biazon Cautions Opposition To Guard Against Cheating</i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">I would like to caution especially the Opposition candidatesincluding the Administration candidates but more so the Opposition candidatesto guard against cheating because some cheating machineries have already been put into motion like the reported 100,000 flying voters discovered by Comelec in metro-Manila alone, and maybe that is not only 100,000 flying voters. The PNP and AFP should be concerned and examine all cases and incidents of ambuscades esp if ideologically or politically related. All should be concerned, all political parties about these ambuscades because if not it can only diminish the institutional processes which could mean nearing anarchyanarchy could be an invitation to extra constitutional means esp from people who are desperate to effect changes toward good government.</p>
