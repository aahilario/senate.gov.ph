Press Release<br />
<!-- NewsDate.start -->June 7, 2007<!-- NewsDate.end -->
<p style="text-align: center">
<span class="PRTitle"><!-- NewsTitle.start -->Sine Die Adjournment Speech <br />
by Senate President Manny Villar<!-- NewsTitle.end -->
</span></p>
<!-- NewsBody.start --><p style="text-align: justify">Distinguished Senators, 
ladies and gentlemen,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent:25px">	We are gathered here today 
to close our Third Regular Session and end the 13th Congress of the Philippines.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent:25px">	To the Filipino people to 
whom the Senate of the Philippines is ultimately accountable, we are pleased to 
report that the Chamber has remained faithful to its solemn mandate and to its 
covenant with the nation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent:25px">To my distinguished colleagues, 
allow me to thank you for giving me the opportunity to serve as your President 
during the Third Regular Session. It is an honor to lead illustrious men and 
women who have great passion for the national interest. You gave me your trust 
and confidence as Senate President almost a year ago. And in that span of time, 
I hope that I successfully lived up to your expectations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent:25px">No doubt, this Congress has 
been the most trying for the Senate, yet also the most rewarding.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent:25px">I recall how our independence 
as a co-equal branch of government was tested time and again. Much was done to 
prevent us from carrying out our oversight functions and even abolish the 
Senate. We were an endangered institution on the verge of singing our swan song. 
On both occasions, the Supreme Court served as the forum for our vindication.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent:25px">	So here we are, standing 
together to end another chapter and begin a new one when we open in July. That 
the nation stood with us and by us during those trying times is highly 
gratifying. That the people rallied behind us is very reassuring. And that they 
elected a new set of senators in the just concluded elections is an undeniable 
testimony of the high esteem our people hold for this august chamber.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent:25px">As a legislative body, the 
Senate has been faithful to its primary mission of making laws to address many 
of our country’s most vital concerns. Many of these were among the agenda set 
forth when we opened session in July last year. These include government 
funding, socioeconomic programs and the need to address nagging problems in our 
educational, agricultural, environmental and health sectors, law and order, and 
electoral reform.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent:25px">	I am proud to say that much 
has been accomplished by the Senate in this 3rd Regular Session of the 13th 
Congress. We passed a record number of legislative measures on 3rd reading 
numbering 169 to be exact; 51 measures of national application and 118 measures 
of local application.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent:25px">Allow me to mention some of our 
legislative milestones. I would however, like to request the Secretariat to 
insert into the records a more detailed report accompanying this speech.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent:25px">In the area of economic and 
fiscal reforms, the Senate passed the General Appropriations Act of 2007; the 
70% Input Vat cap; one-time amnesty of certain tax, duties and liabilities for 
certain enterprises in free ports and special economic zones; amnesty on all 
unpaid national internal revenue taxes for 2005 and prior years; and the bill 
making tourism a primary engine of investment, employment, growth and 
development.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent:25px">In the related areas of human 
rights and public order, we passed the Human Security Act of 2007 and a bill 
granting compensation to victims of human rights violations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent:25px">Environment and energy concerns 
were addressed by the Biofuels Act of 2006 and the law prescribing civil 
liabilities for oil pollution damage.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent:25px">In agriculture and fisheries, 
we defined handline fishing and provided effective regulations therein and 
extended the utilization period of the Agricultural Competitiveness Enhancement 
Fund.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent:25px">In the field of labor and 
employment, we came out with legislation to strengthen the regulatory function 
of the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration, to provide additional 
benefits and protection to house helpers and to strengthen the workers 
constitutional right to self organization.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent:25px">A number of timely and 
necessary measures have been passed towards the protection and promotion of 
public health. These are the bills amending the laws on patents to make it 
feasible to lower the prices of medicine; requiring mandatory basic immunization 
services against Hepatitis-B for infants; providing for the control and 
elimination of rabies; promoting breastfeeding; and prohibiting the detention of 
patients in hospitals and medical clinics on grounds of non-payment of hospital 
bills or medical expenses.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent:25px">We prepared the groundwork to 
strengthen the University of the Philippines as a national center of excellence 
with its tradition of leadership in education.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent:25px">A magna carta for public social 
workers was legislated to empower them to become better social service providers 
by giving them recognition, protection and tangible encouragement, as well as 
the amendment to the Magna Carta for disabled persons to give them additional 
privileges and incentives.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent:25px">Good governance has been 
central to the vision of the Senate. We legislated the Automated Election System 
Act of 2006; strengthened the Public Attorneys’ Office as well as the Office of 
the Solicitor General. Likewise, the Senate concurred with the country’s 
ratification of the United Nations Convention Against Corruption. To improve the 
delivery of public services, we passed the bill reducing red tape and preventing 
graft and corruption in the entire government bureaucracy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent:25px">Given the growing demand for 
shelter to the homeless, the Senate passed a law providing for the “no bidding” 
sale of any piece of land owned by the national government intended for 
socialized housing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent:25px">The range of urgent concerns 
addressed by the Senate encompasses a wide spectrum of national priorities. 
Indeed, much has been attained in the Senate’s exercise of its institutional 
function.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent:25px">In recognition of the same, a 
survey showed that the Senate was adjudged the government institution with the 
highest public satisfaction rating of 51% as of February 2007.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent:25px">My highest praise and kudos to 
you all, my fellow Senators and your staff, the Senate committees, and the 
Secretariat. The Senate could not have achieved so much without the keen sense 
of duty and patriotism of all its members, some of whom shall soon be returning 
to private life.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent:25px">To our esteemed colleagues who 
will not be joining us for the next roll call, we wish you the best in your 
future endeavors and may God be with you always. Thank you so much for your 
friendship, your time and your dedication.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent:25px">I pay homage and honor to 
former Senate President Franklin Drilon, Senate President Pro Tempore Juan 
Flavier, Senators Jun Magsaysay, Serge Osmeña, Loi Estrada, Fred Lim, and Ralph 
Recto.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent:25px">Senator Drilon, we thank you 
for your exemplary leadership when you led the Senate through some of its more 
tough and trying times.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent:25px">	Senator Flavier, you were 
indispensable to the Senate President during long drawn-out plenary sessions 
with your patience and wit. Your advocacy for health for all Filipinos is etched 
in the health laws and bills that you either authored or co-sponsored during 
your term.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent:25px">	Senator Magsaysay, ever soft 
spoken and approachable, you were always at the forefront of advancing the 
causes for agriculture, science and technology. Your investigation into the 
“fertilizer scam” will enshrine your name in one of the Senate’s landmark 
investigations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent:25px">Senator Osmeña, the Senate will 
never be the same without you. None can match the time, effort, and painstaking 
research you put into each major bill presented to the floor for deliberation. 
The legislature is richer for all your hard work.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent:25px">	Senator Loi Estrada, your 
legislative advocacy in behalf of women, family, children and the marginalized 
sectors of our society would always be a role model for future legislators.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent:25px">	Senator Lim, your passion 
for law and order, transparency and accountability, especially in local and 
grassroots governance, will be remembered. It will serve you well as you assume 
another important post in public service.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent:25px">Senator Recto, your knowledge 
and expertise in government management, public finance, economics and taxation, 
among others, helped forge innumerable pieces of quality legislation. You have 
continued the noble tradition of your illustrious ancestors and have done them 
proud.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent:25px">Moving on, much remains to be 
done. The road ahead is not as well paved as we wish it to be. There are 
stumbling blocks posed by widespread poverty, social injustice, the tentacles of 
corruption and a wasteful bureaucracy, among others.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent:25px">What we need are new stepping 
stones, the sharing of a national vision to move us irreversibly forward, fresh 
hope in our collective capacity to carve a better future for all, and a 
reaffirmation of real pride in what is true and good in the Filipino.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent:25px">May God bless our country, our 
people, our government and the Senate. Maraming salamat po.</p>
