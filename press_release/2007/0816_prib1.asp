<span class="PRTitle"><!-- NewsTitle.start -->Kapihan sa Senado excerpts (Guest: Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile)<!-- NewsTitle.end --></span>
</p>
<!-- NewsBody.start --><p><em>ON THE SECURITY CONDITION OF THE COUNTRY AND ALL-OUT OFFENSIVE IN SULU AND BASILAN, ESPECIALLY IN CONNECTION WITH THE ON AND OFF PEACE TALKS WITH THE MNLF:</em></p>
<p>SEN. JUAN PONCE ENRILE: THESE ARE PROTRACTED NEGOTIATIONS GOING ON, BOTH WITH THE LEFT AND WITH THE OTHER ARMED GROUPS CHALLENGING THE GOVERNMENT IS COUNTER PRODUCTIVE TO THE INTEREST OF THE NATION, THE PEOPLE AND THE GOVERNMENT. THE LONGER THE NEGOTIATION IS PROLONGED, THE WEAKER THE POSITION OF THE GOVERNMENT BECOMES, AND THE STRONGER WOULD BE THE ADVANTAGE AND BENEFITS TO THE CHALLENGER OF THE GOVERNMENT.  CASE IN POINT IS THE SITUATION IN BASILAN WHY WERE THOSE PEOPLE IN POSSESSION OF SUCH HEAVY LETHAL FIRE POWER, IF THEY WERE NOT ALLOWED FOR THE LONG-LONG TIME, TO ACQUIRE THOSE WEAPONS, STOCK THEIR AMMUNITIONS AND SUPPLIES TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THAT FIRE POWER TO DESTROY A MILITARY CONTINGENT THAT WOULD PASS THRU THEIR "SUPPOSED" TERRITORY. AND SINCE WHEN IS THERE A SPACE IN THE TERRITORY DEFINED IN THE CONSTITUTION THAT IS UNDER THE CONTROL OF ANY ARMED FORCE OTHER THAN THE LEGITIMATE ARMED FORCES OF THE FILIPINO PEOPLE WHICH IS THE ARMED FORCES OF THE PHILIPPINES, AND ITS LAW ENFORCEMENT UNIT, THE PHILIPPINE NATIONAL POLICE. ALL OF THESE THINGS THAT WE ARE SEEING IS A PRODUCT OR PRODUCTS OF THESE PROTRACTED NEGOTIATIONS. THE ENEMY DOES NOT SLEEP. IT BUILDS UP ITS MANPOWER, ITS ARMAMENT STATION. AND YET THE MILITARY IS WIDE-SPREAD. THE LENGTH AND BREADTH OF THE REPUBLIC IS COVERED  BY LAW ENFORCEMENT UNITS, THERE ARE SO MANY OTHER PROBLEMS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT THAT MUST BE ATTENDED TO, AND YET WE CONTINUE THE PROTRACTED EFFORT OF NEGOTIATING. THERE MUST BE A LIMIT TO THESE. IT CANNOT BE AN OPEN ENDED NEGOTIATION? THE GOVERNMENT MUST ASSESS IS THERE ANY BENEFICIAL END PERCEIVED BY THE GOVERNMENT, TO BE ATTAINED BY THIS PROLONGED NEGOTIATION. IF NONE, YOU ARE JUST POSTPONING THE PROBLEM, AND YOU ARE MAKING IT BIGGER. I AM NOT ADVOCATING TO A BLOODBATH IN THIS COUNTRY, BUT GOVERNMENT  MUST BE A GOVERNMENT. CANNOT BE OTHERWISE. THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE A GOVERNMENT IN ORDER THAT YOU HAVE A WELL-ORDERED SOCIETY.</p>
<p><em>ON THE ENTANGLEMENT OF THE MILF-MNLF CONFLICTS IN THE ON-GOING SHOOTING WAR IN SULU:</em></p>
<p>SEN. ENRILE: DURING THE NATIONAL SECURITY MEETING, I ASKED A POINTED QUESTION. FIRST, WHAT IS THE END GAME CONCEIVED BY THE GOVERNMENT?SECOND, IN THE EVENT THAT YOU CANNOT ATTAIN THAT END GAME AND YOU GO TO A FOOLISH GAME (MILITARY OPERATION) TO MAINTAIN THE INTEGRITY AND PROTECT THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY, WHAT ARE YOUR CHANCES OF WINNING OR BEING DEFEATED? THESE ARE THINGS THAT MUST BE ADDRESSED TO THE MINDS OF THE SECURITY PLANNERS OF THE COUNTRY. WHAT IS YOUR LEVEL OF PREPARATION, IN TERMS OF MANPOWER, IN TERMS OF LOGISTICS, IN TERMS OF COMMUNICATION, IN TERMS OF TRANSPORT, IN TERMS OF PROTECTING THE POPULATION FROM POSSIBLE OVERFLOW OF THE CONFLICT, AND IN MAINTAINING LAW AND ORDER IN THE COUNTRY WHILE YOU ARE ADDRESSING THE MORE PRESSING PROBLEM OR CONFLICT IN MINDANAO?</p>
<p><em>ON THE ALLEGED U.S. INVOLVEMENT IN THE SHOOTING IN SULU:</em></p>
<p>SEN. ENRILE:I HAVE MY DOUBTS, I DON'T THINK THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT AND THE AMERICAN MILITARY WOULD BE THAT RECKLESS TO INVOLVE THEMSELVES IN A CONFLICT AREA LIKE MINDANAO DEALING WITH AN INTERNAL PROBLEM OF THIS COUNTRY THAT EASILY. I THINK, IF AT ALL, MAYBE THEY WOULD BE GIVING INTELLIGENCE SUPPORT TO THE MILITARY, THAT'S A POSSIBILITY, OR LOGISTIC SUPPORT. MAYBE, SOME MEDICAL ASSISTANCE OR CIVIC ACTION EFFORT. BUT TO EMPLOY THEIR COMBAT TROOPS IN AN OPEN WARFARE, I THINK IT IS RATHER NEBULOUS AT THIS POINT. NOT CLEAR.</p>
<p><em>ON THE PERCEPTION ON HOW THE CONFLICT WILL END:</em></p>
<p>SEN. ENRILE: THIS IS THE NAGGING QUESTION THAT I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN CONFRONTED WITH.  WE NEGOTIATED WITH THE MNLF, AND WELL AND GOOD. THE NEGOTIATION WAS A GOOD EFFORT. BUT WHY WAS IT THAT THERE WAS NO DISARMAMENT. THE MNLF WAS NOT DISARMED. NOW, WE ARE NEGOTIATING WITH ALL OF THESE GROUPS, ARMED GROUPS IN THE COUNTRY. DOES THE NEGOTIATION OR THE NEGOTIATIONS GOING ON? THAT ALL OF THESE PEOPLE WILL SURRENDER THEIR ARMS. AND IF THEY DO SURRENDER THEIR ARMS IN THE END, WHO WILL SUPERVISE THE SURRENDER OF THESE ARMS TO BE SURE THAT THE REAL WEAPONS, NOT FAKE WEAPONS, OR PALTIKS WOULD BE SURRENDERED. BUT RATHER, THE REAL ARMAMENTS BEING USED IN FIGHTING THE GOVERNMENT.  IN THE CASE OF THE MNLF, THERE WAS A NEGOTIATION FOR POLITICAL REASONS, FOR POLITICAL SHOW, BUT THEY LEFT OUT THE ARMAMENTS IN THE HANDS OF THESE PEOPLE, AND THEY ARE BEING USED TO KILL OUR SOLDIERS IN SULU. WAS THAT NEGOTIATION, WAS THAT AGREEMENT BENEFICIAL TO THE COUNTRY?  OR DID IT ONLY LULL THIS GOVERNMENT INTO COMPLACENCY BELIEVING THAT IT HAS SOLVED THE PROBLEM, BUT IT DID NOT?</p>
<p><em>ON THE APPARENT ENDLESS AMMUNITION SUPPLIES OF MNLF:</em></p>
<p>SEN. ENRILE:I HAVE ASKED THAT QUESTION ALSO. DO THEY HAVE A HO CHI MINH TRAIL? IF SO, WHERE ARE THE ARMED SUPPLIES COMING FROM.  NOBODY COULD ANSWER THAT QUESTION. I HAVE NOT HEARD AN ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION. YOU CANNOT HAVE AN ARMY WITHOUT A SOURCE OF WEAPONRY AND BULLETS TO FIRE.</p>
<p><em>ON INSTANCES WHEN AN ATROCITY IS COMMITTED, IT IS ATTRIBUTED TO THE "LOST COMMAND":</em></p>
<p>SEN. ENRILE:NOT ONLY THAT, HAVEN'T YOU NOTICED AN ORCHESTRATED EFFORT, ONCE THE MILITARY WILL MOVE TO ENFORCE THE AUTHORITY OF THE REPUBLIC, A CHORUS WILL COME UP, "OH! IT WILL PROLONG THE WAR! IT WILL COST US MONEY! IT WILL COST US LIVES!  IT WILL DISRUPT CIVILIAN POPULATION!".  THAT'S THE PURPOSE OF THE MILITARY ORGANIZATION OF THE REPUBLIC, OR OF ANY COUNTRY FOR THAT MATTER. TO MAINTAIN ORDER.  IF THAT IS THE THINKING, WE MIGHT JUST AS WELL DISMANTLE THE MILITARY ORGANIZATION. WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THE MILITARY ORGANIZATION, BY THE WAY. DECORATION FOR PARADE?.... </p>
<p><em>ON THE PROPOSED RESOLUTION OF SEN. TRILLANES  TO INVESTIGATE ALLEGED PARTICIPATION  OF MALACANANG OFFICIALS IN THE AMBUSH IN BASILAN, AND THE CONDITION OF SEN. BIAZON TO HAVE HIM IN THE SENATE IN ORDER TO TAKE IT UP:</em></p>
<p>SEN. ENRILE:HINDI KO TINUTURUAN SI SEN. BIAZON, DAHIL SYA ANG CHAIRMAN, PERO HINDI AKO SUMASANG-AYON SA SINABI NYA NA HINDI NYA DIDINIGIN YUNG RESOLUTION NI TRILLANES, KUNG HINDI PUPUNTA SI TRILLANES DITO. KUNG HINDI MAKAKAPUNTA SI TRILLANES DITO, AY PWEDENG PUMUNTA ANG SENADO SA KANYA AT TANUNGIN, "O, ANO BA TALAGA? SINO BA ITONG MGA ITO? " HE CAN BE USED AS A RESOURCE PERSON, IN HIS PLACE OF CONFINEMENT, BY THE SENATE. WE HAVE DONE THAT BEFORE. WE CONDUCTED HEARINGS IN MINDANAO, OR IF NOT IN FORT BONIFACIO, WHEREVER HE IS DETAINED. IN THE VISAYAS, IN NORTHERN LUZON. WHY CAN'T WE NOT GO TO A MILITARY CAMP, AND CONDUCT HEARINGS THERE. WHY ONLY HERE IN THE PLENARY? UNLESS, THE PURPOSE IS SOMETHING ELSE, TO FORCE THE COURT TO ALLOW TRILLANES TO COME TO THE SENATE..</p>
<p><em>ON THE STABILITY OF LEADERSHIP OF SENATE PRESIDENT VILLAR, AND CLAIM OF SENS. PIMENTEL AND ROXAS THAT THE THREAT WOULD COME FROM THE MAJORITY COALITION:</em></p>
<p>SEN. ENRILE: I DON'T THINK THERE IS ANY GROUP IN THE SENATE THAT CAN DISLODGE THE SENATE PRESIDENT IN THE MAJORITY, AT LEAST IN THE CASE OF THE MIDDLE GROUP, WE HAVE EXERCISED THE RIGHT TO VOTE, AND WE VOTED THE SENATE PRESIDENT , I DON'T THINK WE WILL BE THAT FOOLISH TO JUST PLAY AROUND AND TURN OUR BACKS ON WHAT WE HAVE ALREADY DONE,  WHICH IS TO ELECT MANNY VILLAR AS PRESIDENT OF THE SENATE..</p>
<p><em>ON SOME SENATORS WANTING TO HAVE MORE COMMITTEES IN THE SENATE:</em></p>
<p>SEN. ENRILE:KUNG MARAMI KANG COMMITTEE, MAS MARAMI KANG ISSUES, MARAMI KANG APPEARANCE SA MEDIA, SA TELEVISION,  SA RADIO, MARAMI KANG PUBLICITY. IT IS A PASSPORT TO 2010.</p>
<p><em>ON THE ALLOCATION OF SEATS IN THE COMMISSION OF APPOINTMENTS (CA), PROPORTIONAL TO POLITICAL PARTIES UNDER THE CONSTITUTION:</em></p>
<p>SEN. ENRILE:IT IS IMPRACTICAL UNDER OUR PRESENT POLITICAL CONDITION, BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY PARTIES. AND SOME OF THESE PARTIES, THEY HAVE ONLY ONE MEMBER IN THE CHAMBER, SOME HAVE TWO. SOME HAVE THREE. SOME HAVE FOURIN THE CASE OF THE PMP, THERE ARE TWO OF US, JINGGOY AND I. THE TWO OF US. SO WE ARE ENTITLED TO ONE. BUT GREG JOINED ME, AND BY THAT THE PMP IN THIS GROUPING, WITHOUT BEING A PMP, AND I THINK JINGGOY, CONVINCED SOMEONE TO JOIN THE TWO OF US, SO WE ARE FOUR...SO THE PMP CAN COUNT ON FOUR SENATORS, FOR PURPOSES OF ALLOCATION OF MEMBERSHIP IN THE COMMISSION ON APPOINTMENTS.(ON SEN. JOKER ARROYO) I THINK IT WAS THE CONSENSUS AMONG US 9 MEMBERS OF THE MIDDLE GROUP, TO GIVE HIM A SEAT IN THE COMMISSION OF APPOINTMENTS SINCE HE HAS NOT TAKEN ANY COMMITTEES</p>
<p><em>ON JDV'S AMNESTY PROPOSALS:</em></p>
<p>SEN. ENRILE:I WILL NOT LIMIT IT TO THE POWERFUL, INFLUENTIAL AND THE RICH, AND I WILL NOT LIMIT IT TO POLITICAL CRIMES. I WILL ALSO INCLUDE ECONOMIC CRIMES, BECAUSE IF SOMEBODY IS ACCUSED OF CORRUPTION, GRAFT AND CORRUPTION, OR LARGE SCALE ECONOMIC LOOTING, LIKE THIS CURRENT SCANDAL WORTH ABOUT 250 MILLION DOLLARS THAT HAS BEEN DRAINED FROM THE COUNTRY, IT WOULD BE COVERED IN THE AMNESTY..</p>
<p><em>ON THE SUGGESTION OF SEN. PIMENTEL THAT THE ONLY SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEMS OF MINDANAO IS TO SHIFT TO FEDERALISM:</em></p>
<p>SEN. ENRILE:IT IS NOT THE ONLY SOLUTION, BUT IT IS A POSSIBLE SOLUTION. I AGREE WITH HIM. IN FACT, THINKING ABOUT IT, MAYBE IT IS TIME. SINCE WE ARE A DIVERSIFIED SOCIETY.  EACH ONE HAS A WAY OF LOOKING AT HOW WE SHOULD RUN OUR LIVES IN OUR RESPECTIVE REGIONS. I WOULD ADVOCATE THE CREATION OF SEVERAL STATES IN THIS COUNTRY. MAYBE THE PRESENT REGIONAL DIVISION, WITH A CERTAIN MODIFICATION TO MAKE THE GROUPING VIABLE, WILL SETTLE. AND EACH REGION WILL TAKE CARE OF ITS OWN. IT'S OWN PEACE AND ORDER, IT'S OWN RESOURCES, IT'S OWN DEVELOPMENT, I WOULD GO ALONG WITH THAT. AND I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT MY REGION WILL SUPPORT THIS PROPOSITION. IN FACT WE ARE QUIETLY DOING SOMETHING IN MY REGION THAT WILL SOMEDAY BECOME, HOPEFULLY, A MODEL IN THIS COUNTRY(BUT THAT WOULD ENTAIL THE REVIVAL OF CONSTITUTIONAL REVISION) OF COURSE, WE HAVE TO REVISE THE CONSTITUTION. WE CANNOT STAND STILL, WE HAVE TO CHANGE COURSE IF NECESSARY, IN ORDER TO FIND A SUITABLE FORM OF GOVERNMENT THAT IS IN ACCORD WITH OUR DIVERSITY, ETHNIC DIVERSITY. (END OF FILE)</p>
