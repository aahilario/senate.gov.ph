Press Release<br /><!-- NewsDate.start -->April 24, 2007<!-- NewsDate.end --><p>
<span class="PRTitle"><!-- NewsTitle.start -->KAPIHAN SA SENADO excerpts <br />(Guests: Senator Juan Ponce Enrile & Former Senator Gringo Honasan)<!-- NewsTitle.end --></span></p>
<!-- NewsBody.start --><p><i>ON STRATEGY FOR THE LAST THREE (3) WEEKS OF REMAINING CAMPAIGN PERIOD:</i></p>
<p>FORMER SEN. GRINGO HONASAN:  THE ANALOGY IS I AM THE THIRD SHIFT. YUNG FIRST TWO SHIFTS, GINAWA NA NINYO.  GINAWA NA NA TAONG BAYAN. I WILL CARRY THE BATON  TO THE FINISH LINE. IT WILL BE THREE INTENSE, HEART-POUNDING  EXCITING WEEKS  I WILL DO THE BEST WITH WHAT I HAVE, I HAVE A VERY COMPETENT CAMPAIGN MANAGER, MY ELDEST SON KIM, WHO HAS DELIVERED. HE IS MY CAMPAIGN MANAGER, HE CALLS THE SHOTS, WITH A LOT OF ADVICE FROM MANONG JOHNNY, AND WELL-MEANING FRIENDS FROM BOTH SIDES OF THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM. I AM CONFIDENT THAT WE WILL BE UP TO THE TASK OF ADDRESSING THE DEMANDS OF THE REMAINING DAYS OF THE CAMPAIGN.  BEING INDEPENDENT,  AND I WOULD LIKE TO CATEGORICALLY TO STATE THIS ONCE AND FOR ALL FOR THE RECORD, I FILED MY CANDIDACY AS AN INDEPENDENT, AND I WILL FINISH THIS CAMPAIGN AS AN INDEPENDENT.  THE MARCHING ORDERS TO OUR TROOPS, MY PARTY, THE FILIPINO PEOPLE IS, WHAT IS GOOD FOR THE COUNTRY , WE WILL SUPPORT. WHAT IS BAD FOR THE COUNTRY, WE WILL FIGHT.</p>
<p><i>ON TEMPORARY RELEASE OF HONASAN, AND THE CASES OF OTHER POLITICAL CANDIDATES:</i></p>
<p>SEN. JUAN PONCE ENRILE: IT IS A MATTER OF EVALUATION OF THE CASE, AND IT IS THE JUDGE THAT CONTROLS THE CASE. NOBODY ELSE.  IF HE SAYS, I GRANT BAIL, THAT IS THE PREROGATIVE OF THE JUDGE. YOU CANNOT QUESTION HIS DISCRETION, AND HE DOES THIS ON THE BASIS OF THE NATURE OF THE CASE BEFORE HIM, THE ALLEGATION OF THE INFORMATION AND EVIDENCE APPRECIATED BY HIM.  NOW IN THE CASE OF TRILLANES, HE IS UNDER CONFINEMENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ARTICLES OF WAR. I DONT KNOW IF HE HAS A CASE IN COURT. IF HE HAS A CASE IN COURT, WELL, LET  THE COURT MAKE A JUDGMENT FOR HIM, BASED ON THE CASE FILED AGAINST HIM, THE NATURE OF THE INFORMATION AGAINST HIM, AND THE EVIDENCE AVAILABLE FOR THE APPRECIATION OF THE COURT.  IT IS EASY TO THINK OF COMPARTMENTED JUSTICE, OR DOUBLE STANDARD OF JUSTICE, THERE IS NO PARI PASSU IN ALL OF THE CASES PENDING IN COURT. THESE ARE SEPARATE CASES TO BE SEPARATELY EVALUATED</p>
<p><i>ON TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE SITUATION (CONFINEMENT) TO RAISE AWARENESS ON CANDIDACY:</i></p>
<p>SEN. JUAN PONCE ENRILE: I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT LIKE GREG, I WOULD WELCOME THIS KIND OF  A SITUATION. BECAUSE, THE MORE THEY TALK ABOUT ME, THE MORE PUBLICITY I GET. THIS IS MADE FOR VICTORY. THIS CASE IS GOD-SENT FOR GREG. AND IT IS A CASE THAT WILL LEAD TO VICTORY.</p>
<p><i>ON MAIN ELECTION ISSUES:</i></p>
<p>FORMER SEN. GRINGO HONASAN: MY MAIN ELECTION ISSUE IS UNITY. WE SHOULD BLOT OUT THE FACES AND NAMES FOR A WHILE, AND LISTEN TO THE MESSAGES THAT ARE BEING, THAT ARE EMANATING   FROM ALL SIDES OF THE POLITICAL SPECTURM. AND USE THAT AS A BASIS FOR DETERMINING, NOT SO MUCH OF WHAT WE  ARE AGAINST, BUT WHAT WE ARE FOR. WE MUST HARNESS THE ENERGIES, THE PASSION OF THIS ELECTION, TO GALVANIZE OUR COUNTRY BEHIND A SERIOUS LEGISLATIVE AGENDA. AND POST ELECTION, WE MUST MAKE USE OF MECHANISM LIKE THE LEDAC TO ESTABLISH CLOSE COORDINATION BETWEEN THE EXECUTIVE, THE LEGISLATIVE, AND EVEN THE JUDICIARY TO PUSH THIS AGENDA FORWARD.</p>
<p><i>ON TEMPORARY RELEASE OF TRILLANES TO ENABLE HIM TO CAMPAIGN:</i></p>
<p>FORMER SEN. GRINGO HONASAN: WHAT I WANT IS ONE THING, AND WHAT IS PRESCRIBED BY LAW , ARE TWO DIFFERENT THINGS. IT IS THE COURTS, AS SEN. ENRILE SAID, WHO SHOULD ANSWER AND RESPOND TO THE ISSUE. BUT IF YOU ARE ASKING ME, I WOULD LIKE, I AM PRAYING  THAT LT. SGD. TRILLANES,  KA CRISPIN BELTRAN, AND EVEN FORMER PRESIDENT ESTRADA, THROUGH DUE PROCESS, BE GRANTED THEIR OWN TEMPORARY FREEDOMTHAT IS HOW I FEEL, THAT IT WILL PAVE, THAT WILL LAY THE GROUND WORK FOR PRINCIPLED UNITY AND RECONCILIATION, IF WE ARE UP TO IT.  THERE IS A BIG IF. IF WE CAN TRANSCEND OUR PARTISAN POLITICAL ATTITUDE DURING THIS ELECTIONS, AND WORK FOR THIS COMMON GROUND, THAT WILL LAY A LOT OF ISSUES TO REST. BUT AS I SAID, THE DETERMINATION OF THAT, TECHNICALLY, SHOULD BETHE COURTS. AND IF I AM A BENEFICIARY OF A WORKING JUSTICE SYSTEM, I THINK  WE SHOULD PRAISE THE LORD FOR THAT. AND PRAISE THE JUSTICE SYSTEM, WHOEVER IS AT THE HELM.</p>
<p><i>ON IMPENDING ISSUES OF OPPOSITION AND PRO-IMPEACHMENT OF PRES. ARROYO AFTER ELECTIONS:</i></p>
<p>FORMER SEN. GRINGO HONASAN:  THAT WILL BE A FUNCTION OF HOW THE EVIDENCE WILL BE PRESENTED, AND WHO WILL BE THE REPOSITORY OF THAT EVIDENCE. I HAVE A PERSONAL FEELINGS ABOUT IT, BUT I AM NOT GOING TO FALL IN THAT TRAP AGAIN AND EXPRESS A PERSONAL OPINION ABOUT A VERY PUBLIC ISSUE THAT HAS HEIGHTENED PASSION THAT RESULTED TO WHERE WE ARE NOW. INSTEAD OF FOCUSING ON PROGRAM AND PLATFORMS, WE ARE ATTACKING EACH OTHER . AS IF THERE ARE NO TOMORROW.  AS IF OUR WINNING IN THE COMING ELECTIONS IS DEPENDENT ON HOW VICIOUS WE CAN BECOME. I AM GOING TO TRY  MY DARNEST TO RAISE THE LEVEL OF CAMPAIGN, WHATEVER THE POLITICAL COST IS . IF I LOSE, I LOSE. IF I WIN, I WIN ON THE BASIS OF ISSUES, NOT BECAUSE I ATTACK OR DEFAME A PERSONALITY.</p>
<p><i>ON GMA FACTOR TO WIN IN THE COMING ELECTIONS, AND CHANGES IN ATTITUDES:</i></p>
<p>FORMER SEN. GRINGO HONASAN: I DONT SEE PERSONALITIES, I SEE ISSUES. I SEE THE ULTIMATE BENEFICIARIES, AND THE CONTINUING VICTIMS OF THIS KIND OF POLITICS.  AND I AM SPEAKING OUT NOW, AFTER A FIVE MONTH.I HAD TIME TO REFLECT. AND AS I SAID, I AM GROWING AND I AM CHANGING IN MY ATTITUDES.  IT IS NOT SO WRONG  THAT I CAN CHANGE. I CAN SAY ON A NATIONAL TELEVISION, I WAS WRONG IN USING THE ONLY TOOLS AT OUR DISPOSALS AS MILITARY MEN IN 1986, AND THE SUBSEQUENT ATTEMPTS, NOW THAT I HAVE EXPERIENCE OF 9 YEARS IN THE SENATE. WHERE I SAW FIRST HAND THAT AWAKENING OUR PEOPLE, OPENING THEIR EYES, AND INITIATING CHANGE, CAN BE DONE AFTER ALL, UNDER A DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM, USING PEACEFUL AND LEGAL MEANS. OF WHAT IS SO WRONG WITH THAT KIND OF TRANSITION? OF WHY IS IT THAT EVERYTIME I SAY THAT OR SOMEBODY ASSESS THAT,   THERE IS A DEAL. WHAT DID THEY EXPECT ME TO DO WHEN BAIL WAS BEING GRANTED, SASABIHIN KO, WAG MUNA DAHIL WRONG POLITICAL TIMING.  WAS THAT THE EXPECTATION? YOU KNOW ME, ID BEEN QUIET FOR 9 YEARS, BUT MAYBE I HAVE FOUND MY VOICE WITH YOUR HELP, AND WITH THE HELP OF MY SURROGATE FATHER, SEN. ENRILE.</p>
<p><i>ON FEELINGS WHEN DROPPED BY THE OPPOSITION:</i></p>
<p>FORMER SEN. GRINGO HONASAN: SUMAMA BA ANG LOOB KO? OF COURSE. BUT I RECOVERED FROM IT. WHAT CAN I DO? BUT I THANK THEM FOR EVEN INCLUDING ME, CONSIDERING MY NAME. BUT I DONT BLAME ANYBODY. I DONT BLAME PERSONALITIES. I BLAMED THE POLITICAL SITUATION.SAMA NG LOOB SIGURO MGA 5 MINUTESWHAT DO YOU DO WHEN YOU ARE CONFINED, THEN, DINROP KA FROM THE SLATE, AFTER BEING IDENTIFIED FOR SO MANY YEARS WITH LEGAL OPPOSITION. AFTER BEING CHARGED, UNJUSTIFIABLY FOR THINGS YOU DID NOT COMMIT</p>
<p><i>ON MAKING APOLOGIES FOR PAST EVENTS, SUCH AS INITIATING COUP ATTEMPTS:</i></p>
<p>FORMER SEN. GRINGO HONASAN:   IN THE 80S, I WAS A MILITARY MAN. LIKE THOUSANDS OF MILITARY MEN, WE SAW THE NEED FOR CHANGE, SO WE USE THE TOOLS AT OUR DISPOSALS, MILITARY MEANS. WE DIDNT ACHIEVE OUR OBJECTIVES. BUT AT LEAST WE OPENED PEOPLES EYES.  IN THE 90S I BECAME A SENATOR OF  THE REPUBLIC, I SAW AND EXPERIENCE FIRST HAND, THAT OPENING PEOPLES EYES AND INITIATING CHANGE, IS POSSIBLE PALA UNDER A DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM USING PEACEFUL AND LEGAL MEANS. SO I WILL DEDICATE THE REST OF MY LIFE TOWARDS PURSUING THESE  TWIN GOALS OF OPENING PEOPLES EYES AND INITIATING CHANGE THROUGH PEACEFUL AND DEMOCRATIC MEANS. NOW, IF MY ATTITUDE DURING THE 80S INSPIRED OR EVEN ENCOURAGED EXTRA-CONSTITUTIONAL MEANS, I AM SORRY. THAT WAS UNINTENTIONAL.</p>
<p><i>ON THE NEW GRINGO THAT GREETED THE MEDIA:</i></p>
<p>FORMER SEN. GRINGO HONASAN: DO I LOOK DIFFERENT OR SOUND DIFFERENT. WELL, MAYBE THATS PART OF DIVINE WILL WHEN YOU ARE IN CONFINEMENT, YOU COME TO TERMS WITH YOUR OWN MORTALITY, AND YOU COME FACE TO FACE WITH THE ONLY COMPANY YOU HAVE, WHICH IS YOUR GOD. NOW, WHAT IS WRONG WITH THAT. IT RESULTED IN A RECONSTITUTED GRINGO HONASAN. THAT FOR ME IS A BLESSING . AND I HAVE DISCOVERED THAT MY FAMILY IS MY PRIMARY ASSET IN ANY SITUATION. MY EXPANDED FAMILY, MY FRIENDS, WHO KEPT FAITH AND CAMPAIGNED ON THE BASIS OF A VERY UNCERTAIN SITUATION. MAKAKALABAS BA YAN O HINDI.</p>

<p><i>ON AWARENESS AND FEELING ON THE DECISION OF SENS. SOTO AND ORETA TO JOIN THE ADMINISTRATION:</i></p>
<p>FORMER SEN. GRINGO HONASAN: IT WAS A JUDGMENT CALL ON THEIR PART. BASED ON CONSIDERATION, I WAS NOT AWARE OF.  BUT THESE TWO ARE MY FRIENDS, I CANNOT DENY THAT. IF THEY WERE THINKING OF ASKING ME IF I WAS WILLING TO JOIN THEM, UNDER THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES, THAT WOULD BE A JUDGMENT CALL ON OUR PART, WHICH NEVER MATERIALIZE BECAUSE I CONTINUED TO REMAIN IN DETENTION, AFTER TEAM UNITY WAS COMPLETED.</p>
<p><i>ON ANY RESTRICTION ON TEMPORARY RELEASE:</i></p>
<p>FORMER SEN. GRINGO HONASAN:  WALA NAMAN. AT LEAST THE MOST SIGNIFICANT WHICH I HOPE WOULD NOT BE LIMITED IS MY ACCESS TO MEDIA, CONSIDERING THE THREE WEEKS.</p>
<p><i>ON LEGITIMACY OF PRESIDENT ARROYO  AS A PREREQUISITE TO ACHIEVE NATIONAL UNITY:</i></p>
<p>FORMER SEN. GRINGO HONASAN: I MUST ADMIT IT IS STILL HANGING IN THE AIR.  BUT YOU CANNOT MIX THAT ISSUE WITH THE CURRENT CAMPAIGN PERIOD. NOW IF THERE ARE GROUPS OR INDIVIDUALS, WHO SEE IT AS A VEHICLE THAT WOULD BENEFIT THEIR OWN CAMPAIGN, THATS THEIR CALL. BUT MY THINKING IS DAPAT IPILIT NATIN NA ISSUES LANG ITO. KUNG ISYU YAN, AND ISYU YAN SA ELECTORATE, WE WILL FIND OUT IN MAY 14.  BUT AS I SAID, AKO, I WILL NOT JUMP INTO THAT, FOR OR AGAINST.  I WILL NOT EVEN ARTICULATE PUBLICLY MY PERSONAL  OPINION ON THE MATTER, BECAUSE I DONT HAVE ALL THE INFORMATION. I DONT WANT TO RISK MYSELF.  TINATANONG AKO, AM I CONVINCED, ABOUT THE VALIDITY OF THE SO-CALLED GARCI TAPES, SABI KO , NO, BECAUSE, AND TRABAHO KO NUNG HULING ELECTION, IS BANTAY BALOTA NI FPJ AT PERSONAL SECURITY NYA, FOR WHICH I WAS NOT GIVEN THE AUTHORITY AND SUPPORT COMMENSURATE TO THE RESPONSIBILITY THAT WAS GIVEN TO ME. I DID NOT FOCUS ANYMORE ON OTHER ISSUES. THERE SHOULD BE A CLOSURE, BUT IF WE PUT CLOSURE TO THAT, TO DO THIS COMPREHENSIVELY, WE MUST PUT A CLOSURE TO EVERY SINGLE ISSUE CONFRONTED BY PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATIONS.</p>
<p><i>ON GIVING TOUGH TALK AGAINST THE ADMINISTRATION:</i></p>
<p>FORMER SEN. GRINGO HONASAN: ..I DONT WANT TO TALK TOUGH.  I DEFINE WHAT I AM FOR, I WILL  NOT TALK TOUGH AGAINST ANYBODY,  I WILL NOT ATTACK PERSONALITIES. WHATEVER THE INTERPRETATION IS, EVEN IF I WIN OR LOSE.</p>
