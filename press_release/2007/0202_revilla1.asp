Press Release<br /><!-- NewsDate.start -->February 2, 2007<!-- NewsDate.end --><p style="text-align: center">
<span class="PRTitle"><!-- NewsTitle.start -->REVILLA BUCKS TRAPOS HITTING ACTORS IN POLITICS<!-- NewsTitle.end --></span></p>
<!-- NewsBody.start --><p>Senator Bong Revilla today dismissed flogging remarks on actors in politics by a trapo who said that voters should not allow anymore showbiz enter politics especially the Upper House because those who were elected to offices do not have any accomplishments and performance to speak of.</p>
<p>Revilla, who was insinuated in the said remark along with other personalities in the Senate, said he cannot blame old politicians raring a comeback in politics to dish out such unkind remarks against personalities who were elected by the people in a clean and clear mandate. This is election season already and sour graping and mud slinging is expected to happen everywhere. To be able to catch the audiences attention, the trend now is to each his own gimmickry. One of that is to use personalities as ones stage for a comeback.</p>
<p>I am not at all slighted because I am only serving the first half of my mandate in the Senate. I know what I have done and what I am doing in the period of just almost three years in legislation. I know there is still a lot more to learn and do and that is where our eyes are set.</p>
<p>He went on to say that he does not parrot his accomplishments in the legislature, as he admits he cannot speak yet of a sterling record in the filed of crafting laws. However, Revilla said the bills that he had passed, filed and heard in the Upper House have been benchmarked for their economic, social and cultural impact to the community and its people.</p>
<p>The senator however mentioned some of the most important bills he had passed and filed among them 6 local bills for road conversion already passed during the 13th Congress. Among the bills currently being heard on the floor and which Revilla advocate on are the anti-pornography act, reduction of amusement tax, anti-gender discrimination bill which was commended by an international human rights group, and the anti-billboard act. He also co-authored the juvenile justice bill and the bio fuel in the senate.</p>
<p>The other day, we just sponsored 8 local bills for road renaming at the floor, it is already on its second reading and hopefully on Wednesday next week it will already be passed when there are no amendments from the floor.</p>
<p>Revilla said he does not deny that he has yet to prove his mettle in legislation, but he added that he still has a couple of years to do that, unlike those who have long stints in the senate and other political offices but did not create an impact in the lives of the Filipino people. We need young and fresh faces in the government who will create reforms to better the country and its citizens, and not rob and mob them.</p>
<p>I have already been in the government service for a dozen years and my name has not been tainted with any insinuations of corruption and misdeeds. I had never been accused of using my position to further my personal gain Revilla said as a parting shot to his critics.</p>
