<span class="PRTitle"><!-- NewsTitle.start -->Comments on the Report of the President to the Joint Congressional Oversight Committee by Sen. Pia Cayetano<!-- NewsTitle.end --></span>
</p>
<!-- NewsBody.start -->
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Under Section 5 of Republic Act No. 11469 or the Bayanihan to Heal As One Act, the President is mandated to submit a weekly report on theacts performed pursuant to the law.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Thus, the President submitted an eighteen (18)-page report to the Joint Congressional Oversight Committee. It contained details on the various measures being undertaken by government agencies to aid Filipinos during the COVID-19 emergency, including those which have already been started before the passage of the law.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Based on the initial measures of the government, my main recommendations are on: (1) subsidy; (2) health; (3) supply chain; and (4) LGUs' parallel efforts.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">1. <strong>On subsidy</strong>, it is worth recalling that during the Senate deliberations on the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act, everyone understood and agreed on the necessity and urgency of downloading Php 200 billion to support around 18 million Filipino families during the Enhanced Community Quarantine. In fact, the Emergency Subsidy Program has been repeatedly pointed out as one of the main features of the law. As such, there is a need to fast track its implementation, as well as the other programs of the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD), Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE), Department of Agriculture (DA) and other agencies as these will provide the much needed assistance to the Filipino families.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">2. <strong>On health,</strong> unfortunately the Report did not include much details. For that reason, I have chosen to focus on the six (6) key actions that were identified by the World Health Organization (WHO), and ask that the Department of Health (DOH) align their efforts and explain their response not only to the Joint Congressional Oversight Committee, but also to other stakeholders, such as Local Government Units (LGUs), health care workers, and other relevant groups. These six (6) key actions are listed in my recommendations. In addition:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">a. <strong>Testing Kits and Lab Accreditation.</strong> In the past weeks FDA has approved more testing kits. It is also welcome news that along with RITM, five (5) other hospitals are also accredited to run COVID-19 tests. Having said that, DOH should continuously accredit more laboratories to facilitate prompt testing. We are cognizant of the hazards associated with operating the laboratories that will run the tests, but the urgency of accreditation is upon us. Furthermore, the DOH should likewise inform the public of any new technologies that will improve the efficiency and accuracy of testing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">b. <strong>Availability of PPEs. </strong>Cognizant of the world shortage on PPEs, it becomes all the more important for DOH to project the needs per hospital, coupled with prompt allocation and distribution to public and private hospitals, as required by the law. The allocation and distribution 
<strong>should also include national- and LGU- run emergency isolation/quarantine areas</strong>. I am currently going over recommendations from different health experts, but I call on DOH to provide us with their own projections.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">3. <strong>On the supply chain, </strong>the enhanced quarantine over the entire Luzon and the subsequent declarations of various LGUs require closer coordination between the Department of Agriculture (DA), Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG), and the Philippine National Police (PNP) to ensure the flow of agricultural products. The same can be said for other essential supplies that require the intervention and close coordination of the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) with DILG.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">4. <strong>Finally, on the parallel efforts of LGUs,</strong> I recommend that the DILG and DOH provide technical assistance to LGUs in creating the guidelines for identifying and assessing possible sites within their jurisdiction that can be used as possible infirmary/isolation facilities to augment the existing healthcare facilities in their respective jurisdictions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>II. HIGHLIGHTS OF THE PRESIDENT'S REPORT (WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION)</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li>
		<p style="text-align: justify">In compliance with the directive under the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act, the President delivered a live report on the measures adopted to address COVID-19 and submitted an 18-page report to the Joint Congressional Oversight Committee.</p>

		<li>
		<p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;The President delegated most of the powers to specific officials, clearly laying down their responsibilities, emphasizing the need for expediency and giving them sufficient authority so they do not have to ask for clearance from the Office of the President for every action they have to take.</p>

		<p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;<strong>Only two powers are reserved for the President</strong>, which was deemed to have the gravest potential impact on the private sector, and will only be exercised by him when absolutely necessary --</p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>III. RECOMMENDATIONS</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Based on the initial measures detailed above, my main recommendations are on: (1) subsidy; (2) health; (3) supply chain; and (4) LGUs' parallel efforts.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong><em>1. Subsidy</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">During the Senate deliberations on the bill, everyone agreed on the necessity and urgency of downloading the Php 200 billion to around 18 million Filipino families. I cannot overemphasize the urgency of this matter.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The Emergency Subsidy Program has been repeatedly pointed out as one of the main features of the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Understandably, 18 million families across the country is a large number. As such, there is a need to fast track its implementation as well as the other programs of the DSWD, DOLE, DA and other agencies, as these will provide the much needed assistance to the Filipino families.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The DSWD should also provide a more detailed report of the implementation of the Emergency Subsidy Program by providing the number of beneficiaries, areas covered, and amount spent. By providing these relevant data, the government can identify the people who have not yet received assistance and determine the proper allocation of funds.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong><em>2. Health</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The WHO identified six key actions in addressing the current COVID-19 pandemic:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify" class="auto-style1">1) Expand, train and deploy your health care and public health workers;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify" class="auto-style1">2) Implement a system to find every suspected case at community level;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify" class="auto-style1">3) Ramp up the production, capacity and availability of testing;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify" class="auto-style1">4) Identify, adapt and equip facilities you will use to treat and isolate patients;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify" class="auto-style1">5) Develop a clear plan and process to quarantine contacts;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify" class="auto-style1">6) Refocus the whole of government on suppressing and controlling COVID-19.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The DOH should explain their plan of action and how it aligns with these recommendations. It is expected that this will be included in the next report to the Joint Congressional Oversight Committee, but also to other stakeholders, such as LGUs, health care workers, and other relevant groups.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">In the past weeks FDA has approved more testing kits. It is also welcome news that along with RITM, five (5) other hospitals are also accredited to run COVID-19 tests.

Furthermore, the DOH should likewise inform the public of any new technologies that will improve the efficiency and accuracy of testing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Section 4(k) of the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act requires the government to procure medical supplies and equipment, including personal protective equipment (PPEs). These supplies should be allocated and distributed to:</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">According to DOH, 1 million PPEs worth Php 1.8 billion are already on the way. The purchase of additional PPEs is a welcome development but cognizant of the world shortage on PPEs, 
<strong>it becomes all the more important for DOH to project the needs</strong> per hospital, coupled with prompt allocation and distribution to public and private hospitals, as required by the law. The allocation and distribution 
<strong>should also include national- and LGU- run emergency isolation/quarantine areas.</strong> I am currently going over recommendations from different health experts, but call on DOH to provide us with their own projections.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong><em>3. Supply Chain</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">DILG has issued several Advisory Opinions to ensure unrestricted movement of food supply, cargo, and business personnel. Despite this, there is a need to further improve the free flow of supply. We have received reports that La Trinidad, Benguet is closed. In fact, the vegetable cooperative we have been supporting for years has been unable to sell their products. There are similar reports of restricted movement in Ifugao and the Cordillera region in general.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The enhanced quarantine over the entire Luzon and the subsequent declarations of various LGUs require closer coordination between the DA, DILG, and the PNP to ensure the flow of agricultural products. The same can be said for other essential supplies that require the intervention and close coordination of DTI with DILG.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong><em>4. Local Government Units (LGUs) Parallel Efforts</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The repurposing of various public facilities such as the PhilippineInternational Convention Center (PICC), World Trade Center (WTC), Rizal Memorial Coliseum, and Philsports Arena as infirmary/isolation facilities is a welcome development. This will be much needed given the trajectory and projections that there will be a significant increase in the cases of COVID-19 positive in the country.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Since time is of the essence in our fight against this pandemic, LGUs should also start identifying and assessing possible sites within their jurisdiction that can be used as possible infirmary/isolation facilities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">They should start preparing for the possible scenario that more of their constituents could become COVID-19 positive and their existing healthcare facilities will not be able to handle such a situation. Thus, I recommend that the DILG and DOH provide technical assistance to LGUs in creating the guidelines for identifying and assessing possible sites within their jurisdiction that can be used as possible infirmary/isolation facilities to augment the existing healthcare facilities in their respective jurisdictions.</p>
