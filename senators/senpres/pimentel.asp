			<p class="h1_bold">Aquilino Q. Pimentel, Jr.</p>
			<p>
			<img border="1" src="images/pimentel2.gif" style="float: left; position: relative; left: 5; top: 1" width="151" height="200" hspace="10" /></p>
			<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">
			Fearless 
			parliamentarian.&nbsp; Fightingest mayor.&nbsp; 
			Stalwart of democracy.&nbsp; These 
			are but some of the sobriquets given to Aquilino “Nene” Q. Pimentel, Jr. in 
			his years of public service.&nbsp; He 
			has been called other names by his detractors, including Don Quixote de 
			Pimentel for his courageous but sometimes lonely battle against a dictator, 
			corruption in government, electoral fraud and even foreign imperialism.&nbsp;
		    What sticks in the mind more, however, is the reputation that he, as 
			a public official and private individual, has earned for fearlessness, 
			incorruptibility, integrity and honesty.&nbsp;
		    And, yes consistency.</p>
		    <p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px"><b>Jailed for Protesting</b></p>
		    <p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">
			Born into a political family in Cagayan de 
			Oro, the man from Mindanao was catalputed to the national arena as an 
			elected delegate to the Constitutional Convention of 1971, representing 
			Misamis Oriental.&nbsp;
		    The complexity of what had promised to be an inspiring political 
			exercise changed when then President Ferdinand Marcos declared Martial Law 
			on September 21, 1972.</p>
		    <p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">A young and principled lawyer, Pimentel and a few like-minded delegates 
			feared the Concon would produce a Marcos-scripted Constitution and were 
			vocal in their opposition.&nbsp; Pimentel also protested certain provisions as being contrary 
			to the people’s interest.&nbsp; Not 
			surprisingly, in a roundup of those who opposed Marcos, he was arrested in 
			early 1973 and jailed for three months at Camp Crame.&nbsp; Pimentel, who had a young family, bade his wife Bing “Be 
			brave. Don’t cry,” and submitted to the incarceration.</p>
		    <p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">
			He was released from prison in time for the 
			signing of the Constitution.&nbsp;
		    Uncowed by his incarceration, Pimentel refused to sign, along with a 
			few other delegates.&nbsp; In the 
			climate of fear of the Martial Law era, this was a bold move and it widened 
			his repute as an oppositionist.</p>
		    <p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">
			He then lawyered for the National Secretariat 
			for Social Action of the Catholic Bishops Conference to help the poor 
			peasants and the urban poor who were particularly oppressed during the 
			Martial Law era.&nbsp;
		    But he did not fade into oblivion nor did he cease being critical of 
			the dictatorship.</p>
		    <p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px"><b>Held for Leading Demonstration</b></p>
		    <p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">In April 1978, Pimentel ran for a post in the Interim Batasan elections as 
			an official candidate of the Lakas ng Bayan (Laban) party of Metro Manila 
			with Ninoy Aquino.&nbsp; Members of 
			Marcos’ Kilusan ng Bagong Lipunan (KBL) party swept the seats.&nbsp;
		    Pimentel and other opposition leaders like Senator Lorenzo Tañada, 
			Soc Rodrigo, Teofisto Guingona, Fr. Archie Intengan SJ, and Chino Roces 
			loudly protested the defeat of all opposition candidates and denounced the 
			massive cheating that had taken place.&nbsp;
		    Pimentel was one of those arrested for leading a demonstration 
			against what he termed farcical elections.&nbsp;
		    He had spoken out against Marcos’ bid to produce a rubber stamp 
			legislature to win legitimacy for his iron-fisted regime which was 
			increasingly being criticized here and abroad.&nbsp;
		    Pimentel was jailed for two months in Camp Bicutan, Metro Manila.</p>
		    <p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">
			Pimentel’s second stint in prison did not 
			silence him.&nbsp;
		    In fact, it strengthened his resolve to fight for freedom and to 
			oppose electoral fraud.&nbsp; Ever 
			the parliamentarian, he brought the battle from the streets to the polls in 
			January 1980 when Marcos allowed local elections.</p>
		    <p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">His wife Bing recalled they launched his mayoralty bid in Cagayan de Oro 
			with a mere P2,000 in his war chest – all the money the couple could muster.&nbsp;
		    But&nbsp; Cagayanons who 
			believed in him contributed to his campaign and penned his name on their 
			ballot.&nbsp; Pimentel won by a 3-1 margin over his KBL rival, who was 
			fielded by Marcos.&nbsp; Pimentel ran 
			under the coalition banner of the National Union for Democracy and Freedom 
			and the Mindanao Alliance which busted KBL dominance in Misamis Oriental.&nbsp;
		    He and his entire slate of candidates for vice mayor and seven city 
			councilors swept the elections in Cagayan de Oro.&nbsp;
		    His candidates for governor and vice governor also won.</p>
		    <p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px"><b>Ousted as Mayor</b></p>
		    <p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">Pimentel was not to govern his city unhindered.&nbsp;
		    In 1981, while he was on a five-week training course in the United 
			States, the Comelec ousted him for “political turncoatism,” installing the 
			KBL candidate as mayor.&nbsp; The Comelec cited Pimentel for switching from Laban in April 
			1978 to the Narional Union for Democracy and Freedom in December 1979 and 
			then running as candidate of the Mindanao Alliance in January 1980.</p>
		    <p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">
			The Comelec’s move ired the Cagayanons.&nbsp; 
			Pimentel partisans immediately staged peaceful demonstrations to express 
			their displeasure.&nbsp; About 30 of his supporters also started fasting in protest.&nbsp;
		    Six days later, 10,000 of his supporters marched around the city in a 
			nonviolent show of support for Pimentel who was then on an official trip to 
			the US.&nbsp; Thousands more lined 
			the streets to cheer them on.&nbsp; 
			This first-ever demonstration of “People Power” came at a time when Marcos 
			did not lightly tolerate dissent.</p>
		    <p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">
			Meanwhile, in Manila, Pimentel’s lawyer, 
			headed by opposition leaders former Senators Lorenzo Tañada and Soc Rodrigo, 
			along with Abraham Sarmiento, Raul Gonzales and Joker Arroyo, claimed that 
			the Comelec had acted without jurisdiction and contented that the 
			electorate’s will should be respected.&nbsp;
		    The Comelec, however, reaffirmed its decision to oust Pimentel.</p>
		    <p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">
			The conflict made national headlines and 
			photos of demonstrations in Cagayan de Oro appeared in a major daily.&nbsp; 
			To defuse the escalating turmoil, Marcos engineered a truce and reinstalled 
			Pimentel as mayor, pending a Supreme Council decision.&nbsp;
		    Pimentel arrived from the US in time to pick up the reins of city 
			government that had briefly been wrested from him.</p>
		    <p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px"><b>House Arrest</b></p>
		    <p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">In 1983, while he was in Cebu City, Pimentel was arrested on charges of 
			rebellion and was detained.&nbsp; He 
			had allegedly given P100 to new People’s Army commander.&nbsp;
		    Bing Pimentel recalled it was horrible time as the family did not 
			know where he was.&nbsp; They traced 
			him to Camp Sergio Osmeña and later to Camp Cabahug in the City of Cebu.&nbsp;
		    Even as he was held in the military detention centers, his followers 
			from Cagayan De Oro and other parts of the country visited him by the 
			hundreds to boost his morale and keep his spirits high.</p>
		    <p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">
			Nene Pimentel disputed the charges and was 
			later released.&nbsp;
		    Returning home, he was mobbed by thousand of his supporters upon his 
			arrival at the pier of Cagayan De Oro.&nbsp;
		    Later, he was again arrested for allegedly engaging in ambuscades.&nbsp;
		    His supporters contributed centavos and pesos in small denomination 
			to bail him out.&nbsp; Subsequently, 
			Pimentel was placed under house arrest which lasted for almost seven months.</p>
		    <p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">From the confines of his home, Pimentel continued to keep abreast of 
			national news.&nbsp; He helped rally 
			the opposition, ran the city and launched his bid as assemblyman for the 
			Batasang Pambansa.&nbsp; He was, if 
			anything, not quite.&nbsp; He 
			protested relentlessly and fearlessly against injustice, fraud, corruption 
			and Marcos’ dictatorial rule.</p>
		    <p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px"><b>OUSTED AND REINSTATED</b></p>
		    <p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">Then, in the aftermath of the assassination of Marcos’s chief rival, Benigno 
			“Ninoy” Aquino in 1983, Pimentel won a seat in the Batasan Pambansa 
			elections of 1984.&nbsp; But the 
			Marcos government ousted him on the allegation that he had cheated in the 
			elections.&nbsp; The Supreme Court 
			itself recounted the ballots in an electoral contest.</p>
		    <p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">
			The feisty Pimentel, a relentless critic of 
			the Marcos regime, was often seen with Ninoy’s widow, Cory, as they rallied 
			the opposition.&nbsp;
		    At one point, Cory asked him to be her running mate in the 1995 Snap 
			Elections and he agreed.&nbsp; 
			However, at the 11<sup>th</sup> hour, when Cardinal Jaime Sin brokered a 
			political marriage between Cory and Salvador “Doy” Laurel, Jr., Pimentel 
			graciously stepped aside and let history run its course.</p>
		    <p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">The widow toppled the dictator who fled the country.&nbsp; Upon her ascent to power President Aquino appointed Pimentel 
			as Minister of Local Government.&nbsp; 
			He had the unenviable task of dismantling the structure of dictatorship and 
			corruption left behind by the Marcos regime.&nbsp;
		    Pimentel wielded the axe deliberately, gaining a breathing space for 
			the new administration.&nbsp; His 
			critics alleged he had sold positions in the new government, but none could 
			make the charge stick.&nbsp; Pimentel 
			incurred the ire of some but also the respect of those who saw that he did 
			it without fear or favor or taint of corruption.</p>
		    <p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">
			Pimentel’s next assignment in the Aquino 
			administration were as presidential adviser and chief negotiator with the 
			Muslim rebels.&nbsp;
		    He resigned from those post to run for the Senate in the 1987 
			elections.</p>
		    <p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">As Senator, he authored and sponsored several key pieces of legislation, 
			among them the Local Government Code of 1991, the Cooperative Code, the 
			Philippine Sports Commission Act, the Act Creating the Autonomous Region in 
			Muslim Mindanao, and the People’s Small-Scale Mining Act.&nbsp;
		    He also authored and co-sponsored the Generic Drugs Act and the Act 
			Establishing the Philippine Police under a Reorganized Department of 
			Interior and Local Government.</p>
		    <p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">
			Pimentel lost bid for the vice presidency in 
			1992 when he stood as Jovito Salonga’s running mate.&nbsp; 
			During the hiatus in his political career, he established his law practice 
			in Metro Manila, gaining repute as a brilliant and meticulous lawyer, 
			further enhancing his national stature.</p>
		    <p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px"><b>DAGDAG/BAWAS</b></p>
		    <p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">
			Back in the arena of politics, Pimentel was 
			cheated of victory in the 1995 senatorial race through the Dagdag/Bawas 
			scheme.&nbsp;
		    He launched what some termed a quixotic campaign against electoral 
			fraud, but drew enormous support from the populace who sent in their 
			donations to help fund the recount.&nbsp; His quest was not so forlorn after all.&nbsp; Before the Senate Electoral Tribunal, Pimentel established by 
			incontrovertible evidence the existence of a massive Dagdag/Bawas fraudulent 
			count.&nbsp; He also sued the 
			cheaters before the criminal courts where the cases are still being tried.</p>
		    <p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">In the 1998 elections, convinced of the man’s integrity and inspired by his 
			passion for truth and electoral reform, voters resoundingly returned 
			Pimentel to the Senate for a six-year term.&nbsp;
		    Today he serves as Chairman of the powerful Blue Ribbon Committee 
			(the Committee on Accountability of Public Officers and Investigations) and 
			the Committee of the Local Government.</p>
		    <p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">As chair of the Blue Ribbon Committee, he has recommended the prosecution of 
			top government officials of previous administrations in relation to the Expo 
			Pilipino centennial scam and the misuse of the funds of the Retirement and 
			Separation Benefits Systems of the Armed Forces.&nbsp;
		    He has also recommended the prosecution of certain personnel of the 
			Land Registration Administration for involvement in faking of land titles.&nbsp;
		    Recently his committee also conducted series of investigations into 
			the allegation of Governor Luis “Chavit” Singson on jueteng scandal.</p>
		    <p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">
			As Chair of the Committee on Local Government, 
			he has supported far-reaching amendments to further strengthen the role of 
			local government units in national development.&nbsp; 
			He has also gotten senate approval to return the police to the supervision 
			of LGUs and has authored a law to fix the date for elections of ARMM 
			officials.</p>
		    <p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">Yes, in just a few short years, Nene Pimentel has made the leap from feisty 
			oppositionist to inspiring leader, from parliamentarian to respected 
			statesman.&nbsp; Today he would say 
			life’s meaning is found in serving God, country and people, especially the 
			poor.</p>
