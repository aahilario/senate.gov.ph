			<p>
		<img border="1" src="images/villarb2.gif" width="136" height="173" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="3" />
										</p>
						<p style="text-align:justify">
			The public life of Manny Villar straddles both the worlds of 
			business and politics. He is one of the few who managed to excel in 
			both.</p>
				<p style="text-align:justify">
	      <b><u>
	        Working Student</u></b></p>
	        <p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">
	      He was born to a 
			simple family on December 13, 1949 in Moriones, Tondo, Manila.&nbsp; 
			His father, Manuel Montalban Villar, Sr., a government employee, 
			hailed from Cabatuan, Balazan, and Tanza, Iloilo and his mother 
			Curita Bamba, a seafood dealer, came from Pampanga and Bataan.&nbsp; 
			Manny is the second child in a brood of nine.&nbsp; At a very young 
			age, he was already helping his mother sell shrimp and fish in the 
			Divisoria Market.&nbsp; With the burning desire for a better future 
			and a strong determination to improve his family’s living 
			conditions, Manny worked hard in selling shrimps and fish to be able 
			to send himself to school.</p>
				<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">
	      “I learned from my 
			mother what it takes to be an entrepreneur, “ he revealed. “And it 
			means working really hard to achieve your dreams.” In Divisoria, he 
			marveled at the volume of sales that Chinese merchants were making, 
			thus he vowed early on to become an entrepreneur.</p>
				<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">
	      <font size="2">Hard work, 
			persistence, and perseverance became his guiding principles in life. 
			This earned him the title </font><i><font size="2">“Mr. Sipag at 
			Tiyaga.”</font></i></p>
				<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">
	      <font size="2">He continues to 
			inspire Filipinos with his life story and encourages each and every <i>
	        kababayan</i> to improve their quality of life and fulfill their 
			dreams through the very values he believes in -- </font><i><font size="2">
	        “sipag at tiyaga.”</font></i></p>
				<p align="justify">
	      <b><u>
	        Entrepreneur</u></b></p>
				<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">
	      Manny Villar was a 
			working student at the University of the Philippines, the premier 
			institution of higher learning in the country, where he obtained his 
			undergraduate and master’s degree in business administration and 
			accountancy. By then, he was also putting in long hours as fish and 
			shrimp trader, where the action starts during the ungodly hours of 
			the morning when the catch lands on the market.</p>
				<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">
	      After graduation, he 
			tried his hand as an accountant at the country’s biggest accounting 
			firm, Sycip Gorres and Velayo (SGV). He resigned shortly though to 
			venture on his own seafood delivery business. </p>
				<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">
	      When a restaurant he 
			was delivering stocks to did not pay him, he printed out “meal 
			tickets” which he persuaded the restaurant owners to honor. He then 
			sold these tickets at a discounted price to office workers. It took 
			him one year to liquidate his receivables.</p>
				<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">
	      He worked briefly as 
			a financial analyst at the Private Development Corporation of the 
			Philippines. His job was to sell World Bank loans, despite the 
			attractive rates of which there were no takers. Convinced that he 
			could make it on his own again, he quit his job and promptly availed 
			of one of the loans.</p>
				<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">
	      So with an initial 
			capital of P10,000 in 1975, Villar purchased two reconditioned 
			trucks and started his sand-and-gravel business in Las Piñas.</p>
				<p align="justify">
	      <b><u>
	        Housing Innovator</u></b></p>
				<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">
	      It is here while 
			delivering construction materials to big developers that Manny 
			Villar came up with the idea of selling house and lot packages when 
			the convention then was for homeowners to buy lots and build on 
			them.</p>
				<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">
	      Manny Villar became 
			the housing industry leader, and the biggest homebuilder in 
			Southeast Asia, having built more than 100,000 houses for the poor 
			and middle class Filipino families.</p>
				<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">
	      He then initiated 
			mass housing projects to achieve economies of scale. His various 
			innovations practically created the country’s mass housing industry.&nbsp; 
			The Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism calls him “the 
			dean of the (Philippine) real estate industry.”&nbsp;</p>
				<p align="justify">
	      <b><u>
	        Awards and 
			Distinctions</u></b></p>
				<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">
	      For his business 
			achievements, he was made cover story in the Far Eastern Economic 
			Review. And his life story was also featured in Asiaweek, Forbes, 
			AsiaMoney and Asian Business Review.</p>
				<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">
	      He garnered various 
			awards such as the Ten Outstanding Young Men Award (1986) by the 
			Philippine Jaycees, Agora Award for Outstanding Achievement in 
			Marketing Management (1989), Most Outstanding CPA by the Philippine 
			Institute of Certified Public Accountants (1990) and Most 
			Outstanding UP Alumnus (1991).</p>
				<p align="justify">
	      <b><u>
	        Political Career</u></b></p>
				<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">
	      In a stunning 
			political debut in 1992, Villar won with the most overwhelming 
			mandate among congressmen in Metro Manila. He promptly applied his 
			economic and managerial expertise as a key member of the House’s 
			economic team, marshalling in economic reform measures of the Ramos 
			Administration such as the New Foreign Investments Act and the 
			restructuring of the Central Bank of the Philippines. He was the 
			House representative in the government’s negotiations with the 
			International Monetary Fund (IMF) in Washington D.C. in 1992.</p>
				<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">
	      He also oversaw 
			various infrastructure projects in his districts like the 
			construction of concrete roads and the Alabang-Zapote Flyover. He 
			introduced the “Friendship Route” to ease the traffic problems in 
			southern Manila by persuading subdivision homeowners to open up 
			their roads to the general public.</p>
				<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">
	      He succeeded in 
			passing Republic Act 8003 “Declaring Certain Areas in Las Piñas as 
			Tourist Spots”. The law formalized his program of rehabilitating 
			historical and cultural landmarks in Las Piñas starting with the 
			world-famous Bamboo Organ Church. The ongoing project dubbed as “Las 
			Piñas Historical Corridor” covers the stretch of the Old District 
			and may even rival the Intramuros and Vigan restoration projects.</p>
				<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">
	      A staunch 
			environmentalist, he initiated a privately funded tree planting 
			drive in his district. He developed a P10-million tree nursery 
			beside his home. He also quietly led a dedicated tree-planting drive 
			complete with maintenance and watering of tree seedlings planted in 
			the open spaces of the community.</p>
				<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">
	      When he realized 
			that many poor students could not go to school because they do not 
			even have fare money, he organized the “Manpower on Wheels” Program, 
			a livelihood training school housed in a van that makes the rounds 
			in depressed areas. The program has since produced more than 5,000 
			graduates and has been awarded by various government and civic 
			organizations for its innovative scheme.</p>
				<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">
	      During his first 
			term, he steered Las Piñas and Muntinlupa to cityhood.&nbsp; “As a 
			developer, I have always envisioned these two communities as the 
			‘Twin Cities of the South’ of Manila. In fact, Las Piñas and 
			Muntinlupa are the two fastest growing communities in the country 
			today, he pointed out.”</p>
				<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">
	      For his constituency 
			work and personal vow, he extended grants of home sites to some 
			10,000 poor families in Barangay CAA, Las Piñas City. Two major 
			roads were also opened in his district; the Sucat-Pulanglupa Link 
			Road to Parañaque and the Zapote-Molino (Daang Hari) Link Road to 
			Cavite, thus alleviating the traffic congestion in the area.</p>
				<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">
	      During his second 
			term, he was able to upgrade the Las Piñas District Hospital with a 
			new building and better facilities. He also launched the 
			“Sagip-Bukas” Drug Prevention Program on all the private and public 
			schools of Las Piñas to educate the youth about the dangers of drug 
			abuse. He also nationalized the Las Piñas High School to upgrade its 
			facilities.</p>
				<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">
	      By the end of his 
			second term of office, Villar had already proven beyond doubt his 
			capacity for excellence as a true Filipino entrepreneur and a 
			brilliant public servant who can get things done.</p>
				<p align="justify">
	      <b><u>
	        Champion for 
			Entrepreneurs</u></b></p>
				<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">
	      In 1995, Manny 
			Villar ran for re-election and won an unprecedented 142,000 votes, 
			the highest number of votes for a congressman in the entire country. 
			Winning media acclaim as an outstanding congressman as well as the 
			respect and recognition of his peers, he was elected to chair the 
			Committee on Entrepreneurship.</p>
				<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">
	      As one of the 
			leading entrepreneurs in the country, he championed the cause of 
			small and medium-sized enterprises. He authored and passed into law 
			the landmark New Magna Carta for Small and Medium Enterprises (RA 
			8289). He initiated creative legislation such as establishment of 
			the Small and Medium Enterprises Stock Exchange and Business 
			One-Stop-Shop centers, the latter he immediately implemented in Las 
			Piñas City with the help of local officials.</p>
				<p align="justify">
	      <b><u>
	        Speaker of the 
			House</u></b></p>
				<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">
	      It was no surprise 
			then to those in the know when he gained the remarkable acclaim of 
			171 of 220 congressmen as the Speaker of the 11<sup>th</sup> 
			Congress of the House of Representatives.</p>
				<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">
	      In a time when the 
			country is slowly recovering from a host of economic and political 
			crises, the election of the ‘brown taipan’ at the helm of Congress 
			signaled a watershed event in the Philippine political history. The 
			rise of Manny Villar ushered in a new consensus of leadership based 
			on managerial skills and not simply on oratory and rhetoric.</p>
				<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">
	      By his first year in 
			office, Villar undertook three pathbreaking reforms. He succeeded in 
			marshalling consensus in the House to reform the ‘pork barrel’ 
			system by limiting congressional discretion projects to the set 
			parameters of the Executive’s development policies. Secondly, he 
			launched a revamp of leadership by appointing at least seven 
			neophyte congressmen to head powerful committees like ecology and 
			banks. Finally, he set a strong and principled stance on environment 
			protection legislation with the passage of the “Clean Air Act”, a 
			measure that for more than ten years three previous congresses were 
			not able to pass.On his second year in office, Manny Villar steered 
			the 11<sup>th</sup> Congress into a record-breaking achievement in 
			legislation and economic reforms. Among the pioneering measures he 
			shepherded into law were the Retail Trade Liberization Act, the New 
			Central Bank Act, the New Securities Code, and the New Banking Act.</p>
				<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">
	      On November 13, 
			2000, he became the first House Speaker in Philippine history to 
			impeach a President, paving the way for the elevation of the 
			articles of impeachment to the Senate.</p>
				<p align="justify">
	      <b><u>
	        Senator of the 
			Republic</u></b></p>
				<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">
	      In the national 
			elections held last May 14, 2001, despite being a relative newcomer 
			in national politics, Manny Villar posted one of the most impressive 
			showings in the national polls. On his first day in office, he filed 
			204 bills covering a comprehensive legislative program of action— 
			the first among neophyte senators and the third highest filer among 
			the senators of the 12<sup>th</sup> Congress of the Philippines.</p>
				<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">
	      After being elected 
			by his colleagues, he assumed the position of Senate President 
			Pro-Tempore, the second to the highest post in the higher Chamber of 
			Congress. He is presently the Chairman of the Committee on Finance 
			and the Committee on Public Order and Illegal Drugs. He is also the 
			Vice Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations and Committee on 
			Agriculture.&nbsp; He authored 44 laws during the 12<sup>th</sup> 
			Congress, among them are: RA 9178 Barangay Micro Business 
			Enterprises Act, RA 9189 Overseas Absentee Voting Act, RA 9208 
			Anti-Trafficking of Persons Act, RA 9257 An Act Granting Additional 
			Benefits and Privileges to Senior Citizens, and RA 9262 
			Anti-Violence Against Women and their Children Act.&nbsp; He has 
			filed Bills aimed at providing business opportunities for the people 
			and improving the Filipinos’ quality of life through basic health 
			care, decent shelters, responsive social services, and high quality 
			education.</p>
				<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">
	      Outside the Senate’s 
			halls, Villar actively sponsors <i>Sipag at Tiyaga</i> 
	        Caravan Kaalaman, a livelihood training program that provide skills 
			and inspiration to people that will allow them to venture into their 
			own businesses. The caravan travels all over the country conducting 
			livelihood seminars that are consistently widely attended and 
			appreciated. </p>
				<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">
	      He has also 
			spearheaded the building of schools, sending out medical missions 
			and setting up relief operations whenever or wherever needed. He led 
			the inauguration of the Las Piñas-Muntinlupa-Laguna-Cavite (LPMLC) 
			link road, more popularly known as <i>Daang Hari</i>, as part of his 
			road improvement program aimed at easing traffic in the south of 
			Metro Manila.&nbsp; According to him, an efficient and rationalized 
			road network is one of the fundamental requirements in improving 
			commerce and spurring economic progress.</p>
				<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">
	      In February 2004, he 
			was elected as President of the Nacionalista Party—the country’s 
			oldest and grandest political party.&nbsp; He was also named the 
			Most Distinguished UP Alumnus—the highest recognition given by the 
			UP Alumni Association—for his exemplary public service and 
			achievements.</p>
				<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">
	      Senator Manny 
			Villar, despite his numerous accomplishments and heroism, has 
			remained simple and unaffected. A true family man, he is a devoted 
			husband to Rep. Cynthia A. Villar (Lone District of Las Piñas), and 
			a&nbsp; loving father to sons Paolo and Mark and daughter Camille.</p>
