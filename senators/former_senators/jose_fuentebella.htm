		<p>
			Senator Jose Fuentebella was born on June 17, 1883 
			in Sagnay, Camarines Sur, to a family of 
			nationalistic and political leaningsHe graduated 
			with a degree of Bachelor of Arts from Ateneo de 
			Manila in 1902 and Bachelor of Laws from Escuela de 
			Leyes in 1905. He became a member of the Philippine 
			Bar in 1906.

		<p>
			After three years of law practice, Fuentebella took 
			to politics. He was elected representative of the 
			third district, Ambos Camarines, to the Philippine 
			Assembly, for several terms, 1909-1916 and elected 
			provincial governor of Ambos Camarines in 1916.

			He left politics to resume his law practice and look 
			after his familyâ€™s financial interests. The lure of 
			public effective office, however, was strong and he 
			served anew as senator representing the sixth 
			senatorial district in the Philippine Legislature of 
			1928-1935, and then again as representative, 
			National Assembly, 1935-1941.

			in Camarines sur from 1909 until 1955. He was 
			serving as congressman when President Magsaysay 
			appointed him Ambassador extraordinary and

			of Indonesia at Jakarta in March 31, 1955.
