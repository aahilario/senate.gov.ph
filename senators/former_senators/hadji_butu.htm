		<p class="h1_bold">Hadji Butu Abdul Bagui</p>
		<p>
			Hadji Butu was born in the Islamic city of Jolo in the year 1865. 
			The exact date of his birth cannot be ascertained because the Muslim 
			Filipinos do not keep track of time by the Gregorian calendar and 
			also, customarily, they do not keep written records of births. Hadji 
			Butu was of distinguished ancestry, for he was a descendant of 
			Mantiri Asip, famous minister minister of Raja Baginda, Muslim 
			prince from Sumatra who conquered Jolo in 1390. True to the finest 
			tradition of his family, he served as prime minister to various 
			sultans of Sulu.
		</p>
		<p>
			Since early boyhood, Hadji Butu manifested his prodigious 
			intellectuality. He began to study the Arabic language and the 
			Qu’ran (Koran) at the age of six and mastered them in four years 
			time. Despite the turbulence of his time, highlighted by the bloody 
			wars against the Christian Spaniards and Christian Filipinos, he 
			never lost his passionate love for knowledge and peace. He witnessed 
			Spain’s desperate attempts to conquer the Islamic Sultanate of Sulu 
			and the successful resistance of his fighting people - the fearless 
			Taosug warriors. On February 29, 1876, when he was barely 11 years 
			old, a might Christian armada under the personnel command of Admiral 
			Jose Malcampo (concurrently Governor-General of the Philippines) 
			attacked Jolo and captured it after a ferocious combat. Sultan 
			Jamalul Kiram I and his Taosug army evacuated the city and continued 
			their resistance to Spanish power in the moutains.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Taosugs were beaten in various battles, but they were never 
			conquered.
		</p>
		<p>
			As the war against Christian Spain raged, Sultan Jamalul Kiram died 
			and was succeeded by Jamalul A’lam I. On January 22,1878, Sultan 
			Jamalul A’lam, who needed funds to carry on the war against the 
			Christian invaders, signed an agreement with two foreign adventurers 
			- Baron Gustave von Overbeck (Austrian consul in Hongkong) and 
			Alfred Dent (British trader) - wherein he leased his territory in 
			North Borneo, called Sabah, for an annual rent of 5,000 Malayan 
			dollars (U.S. $1,600).
		</p>
		<p>
			On April 8,1818, Sultan Jamalul A‘lam died, and was succeeded by 
			Badarud Din II. Butu was then only 16 years old. Despite his tender 
			age, he was designated prime minister to the new sultan because of 
			his knowledge of the Arabic language and the Qu’ranic law. A years 
			later (1882), he accompanied Sultan Badarud on a pilgrimage to 
			Mecca, the Holy City of Islam in Saudi Arabia. This was his first 
			visit to Mecca, and from this time on till his death he enjoyed the 
			title of Hadji.
		</p>
		<p>
			In Mecca, Hadji fraternized with the learned priests and scholars of 
			Arabia, thereby improving his knowledge of the Arabic language, 
			religion, and jurisprudence. Upon his return to Jolo (together with 
			Sultan Badarud) in January, 1883, he came to be recognized as the 
			foremost Taosug authority on Islamic law and theology.
		</p>
		<p>
			On February 22, 1884, Sultan Badarud Din I died. The sultanate was 
			plunged into the maelstrom of civil war, waged by rival claimants to 
			the vacant throne - Raja Muda (Crown Prince) Amirul Kiram 
			(half-brother of the deceased sultan), Datu Alipud Din, and Datu 
			Harun al Raschid. Hadji Butu persuaded the majority of the Taosug 
			datus to support Amirul Kiram.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Spanish authorities intervened in the dynastic struggle and 
			asked Raja Muda Amirul Kiram and Datu Harun to go to Manila. Amirul 
			Kiram ignored the Spanish invitation, for he was advised by Hadji 
			Butu not to heed the Spanish summon. “Remember what happened to 
			Sultan Alimud Din I in 1749,” he reminded Amirul Kiram.
		</p>
		<p>
			Datu Harun went to Manila. Governor-General Joaquin Jovellar, irked 
			by the absence of Amirul Kiram, proclaimed him sultan. In exchange 
			for Spanish support to his dynastic ambition, Harun pledge 
			allegiance and friendship to Spain.
		</p>
		<p>
			Most of the Taosug people, angered by Harun’s subservience to the 
			hated Spaniards, recognized Amirul Kiram as their legitimate sultan. 
			The civil war continued: this time it was between two sultans - 
			Sultan Harun and Sultan Jamalul Kiram II (dynastic name of Amirul 
			Kiram). With the help of Spain, Sultan Harun won the bloody fight. 
			he captured Maimbung (Kiram’s prime minister) remained at the coast 
			to guard the pass to the mountain stronghold.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Spanish authorities, realizing the influence of Hadji Butu, 
			launched a vigorous campaign to capture him. Eventually, after 
			several weeks of jungle fighting, the elusive Hadji Butu was taken 
			alive and brought to Jolo, where Sultan Harun cordially welcomed him 
			and asked him to become his prime ministerwith the condition that 
			the Sultan will stop the war against Amirul Kiram and rule the 
			people in accordance with the noble tenets of Islamic faith.
		</p>
		<p>
			Shortly after Hadji Butu assumed the premiership under Sultan Harun, 
			Governor-General Ramon Blanco visited Jolo and conferred with him on 
			the restoration of peace and order in the sultanate. Convinced of 
			the sincerity of the Spanish governor-general, Hadji Butu pleaded 
			with Amirul Kiram and his followers to lay down their arms. 
			Evidently, his peacemaking mission was successful because all 
			hostilities ceased. Once more peace reigned over the wartorned 
			sultanate.
		</p>
		<p>
			Under the able advisership of Hadji Butu, Sultan Harun ruled widely 
			and well. he consistently refused Spanish demands to levy taxes In 
			the sultanate for Spain for which reason the Spanish authorities 
			became hostile to him. In 1892, while Hadji Butu was in Sandakan 
			settling certain land troubles with the British government, the 
			energetic mother of Amirul Kiram secretly intrigued with the Spanish 
			authorities to replace Sultan Harun and exiled him to Palawan.
		</p>
		<p>
			Upon his return to Jolo, Hadji Butu was persuaded by 
			Governor-General Ramon Blanco to became once more prime minister of 
			Amirul Kiram, who took the name Jamalul Kiram II when he ascended 
			the throne in 1894. Two years later he accompanied the new sultan on 
			a pilgrimage to Mecca. This was Butu’s second visit to Islam’s Holy 
			City, which lasted one year.
		</p>
		<p>
			In April, 1898, shortly after Hadji Butu’s return to Jolo from 
			Mecca, the Spanish-American War broke out. On May 1st, the American 
			squadron under the command of Commodore George Dewy sank Admiral 
			Montojo’s fleet in Manila Bay. On June 12, 1898, General Emilio 
			Aguinaldo, who had returned to the Philippines from exile in 
			HongKong aboard one of Dewey’s vessels, proclaimed the Declaration 
			of Philippine Independence at Kawit, Cavite, and urged his people to 
			resume their libertarian struggle against Spain which was 
			temporarily halted by the “Pact of Biak-na-Bato.” On August 13, the 
			American land forces under General Wesley E. Merritt, supported by 
			the Filipino troops, crushed the Spanish army and capture Manila. 
			Finally, on December 10, the Spanish-American War ended, with the 
			signing of the Treaty of Paris. This treaty brought peace between 
			Spain and the United States, but it ignited a more destructive 
			conflict - the war from Philippine independence (1899-1902).
		</p>
		<p>
			Hadji Butu watched the portentous events in Luzon with keen 
			interest. on May 19, 1899, while the forces of the First Philippine 
			Republic under President Emilio Aguinaldo were courageously 
			resisting the American invaders, two American battalions occupied 
			Jolo. The following month, on August 20, Hadji Butu, representing 
			Sultan Jamalul Kiram II, concluded a treaty with General John C. 
			Bates. According to this so-called “Bates Treaty,” the Sultan of 
			Sulu recognized American sovereignty and, in return, the United 
			states recognized the sultanate as an American protectorate and 
			agreed to respect the Islamic religion and customs (including 
			polygamy and slavery) of the Taosug people and not to cede or sell 
			Sulu or any part of it to any foreign country.
		</p>
		<p>
			A statesman of foresight and sagacity, Hadji Butu realized the 
			futility of resisting American arms. For the sake of peace and to 
			prevent unnecessary loss of lives and property in Sulu, he 
			cooperated with the Americans and advised his people to accept 
			American rule. On October 10, 1904, he was appointed by the American 
			military authorities as assistant to the Military Governor of the 
			province. Subsequently, on June 20, 1913, General John J. Pershing 
			(Military Governor of the Moro Province) promoted him as Deputy 
			District Governor of Sulu. In the same year the military rule in the 
			Moroland was ended and the Department of Mindanao and Sulu was 
			established.
		</p>
		<p>
			In December, 1915, Hadji Butu was appointed by Governor-General 
			Francis Burton Harrison as senator, representing the 12st Senatorial 
			District (Mindanao and Sulu). He was thus the first Muslim to sit in 
			the Philippine Senate. He proved to be an able parliamentarian so 
			that he was re-appointed senator by Governor-General Henry L. 
			Stimson in 1928.
		</p>
		<p>
			The first bill sponsored by Hadji Butu in the Senate provided for 
			the establishment of a Philippine Military Academy, a Philippine 
			Naval Academy, and for compulsory military instruction in all 
			schools and colleges in the Philippines.
		</p>
		<p>
			As a senator, Hadji Butu worked hard for more appropriations for the 
			construction of more schools, hospitals, roads, and bridges in 
			Mindanao and Sulu.
		</p>
		<p>
			One of Hadji Butu’s sterling qualities was his flaming love of the 
			Philippines. He was a sincere advocate of Filipino nationalism - one 
			country, one people, one flag.
		</p>
		<p>
			Together with Manuel L. Quezon, Sergio Osmeña, and other Filipino 
			patriotic leaders, he crusaded vigorously for Philippine 
			independence during the American regime. He welcomed the Jones Law 
			of 1916, for he considered it to be “a great step towards the 
			attainment of the national ideal.” From 1919 to 1934, he campaigned 
			for the independence cause in Mindanao and Sulu, urging the Muslim 
			Filipinos to support their Christian brothers in the peaceful 
			struggle for the restoration of Filipino freedom. He was senator 
			from 1916-1931.
		</p>
		<p>
			Hadji Butu was blessed with four sons and eight daughters.
		</p>
		<p>
			On February 22,1937, a year after his appointment by President 
			Quezon as member of the Board of National Language (representing 
			Mindanao and Sulu), Hadji Butu. age 72, died of kidney ailment at 
			his residence in Jolo.
