		<p>
			GERONIMA T. PECSON, the first Woman Senator of the Philippines, was 
			born in Barrio Libsong, Lingayen, Pangasinan on December 19, 1896. 
			she was the second child of Victor Tomelden and Pacita Palisoc. She 
			had early studies in the public schools of Lingayen. She earned her 
			Bachelor of Science and Master of Arts degrees from the University 
			of the Philippines. She married Potenciano Pecson, her fellow 
			student at the state university.
		</p>
		<p>
			A well-known suffragette, Geronima Pecson was a “silent-achiever”. 
			She went about her work minus the attendant fanfare. Her outstanding 
			accomplishments were substantiated by the numerous awards she 
			received from civic, religious and educational institutions. She 
			once said, “I would project my work rather tan myself.”
		</p>
		<p>
			As a Senator, she headed the three important committees, namely, the 
			Senate Committee on Education, the Senate Committee on Health and 
			Public Welfare, and the Joint Congressional Committee on Education. 
			She was also a member of the Commission on Appointments and of the 
			Senate Electoral Tribunal. She was the prime mover of various 
			notable laws, such as the Free and Compulsary Education Act of 1953; 
			the Vocational Educaion Act; the law permitting the establishment of 
			training facilities for instructors in specific national school of 
			arts and trades; and the law transforming the school of forestry of 
			the University of the Philippines into a college.
		</p>
		<p>
			Known in civic circles as a “super-social worker”, she worked as a 
			private secretary to President Jose P. Laurel. In 1946, she served 
			as an Assistant Executive Secretary of President Manuel A. Roxas. A 
			year later, she joined the senatorial elections, and made political 
			history by garnering the third largest number of votes. She then 
			became the first woman senator.
		</p>
		<p>
			Senator Pecson was the recipient of distinguished awards, among 
			which were the Press Association’s Legion of Honor Award from the 
			President of the Philippines, Pro Patria Presidential Award, 1964 
			Outstanding Award for excellent service in Philippine education, 
			Presidential medals and citations for “educational statesmanship 
			through legislation” and for “being the first Filipino and first 
			woman elected to the executive board of UNESCO”.
		</p>
		<p>
			Geronima T. Pecson – senator, educator and social worker – was 
			indeed a leader of the Filipino women in nation-building.
