		<p class="h1_bold">John Henry&nbsp; R. Osmeña</p>
		<p>
			Senator John Osmeña is known as the “Lone Ranger” for his 
			independent mindedness and taking fearless stance despite 
			overwhelming odds. He is a known graft-buster in the Senate. He has 
			been a very vigorous opponent of the perceived extension of 
			President Fidel V. Ramos’ term.
		</p>
		<p>
			As graft-buster, Sen. Osmeña was behind the Senate investigations of 
			many irregular and anomalous government transactions, including the 
			so-called Petroscam, and those involving the Philippine Airlines and 
			the Philippine Ports Authority, among others. His exposes have led 
			to the resignation of corrupt government officials.
		</p>
		<p>
			Senator Osmeña sponsored among others, a number of 
			development-oriented bills like the Municipal Telephone Act 
			(Republic Act 6849) whereby each municipality will a get a telephone 
			system; the Mini-Hydroelectric Program (RA 7156), which will provide 
			non-conventional electricity in the countryside; the Public 
			Telecommunications Act of 1995 (RA 7925), and the creation of the 
			Philippine Postal Corporation (RA 7354). He also authored landmark 
			bills like the Electric Power Crisis Act (RA 7648) and the Build 
			Operate Law (RA 7718).
		</p>
		<p>
			He was also responsible for the creation of the Department of Energy 
			(DOE) after his Senate Bill was signed into law by President Ramos 
			in 1992 in what is more popularly known as RA 7638.
		</p>
		<p>
			At present, Sen. Osmeña is in his fourth term as senator, which 
			makes him the most senior member of the Philippine Senate in terms 
			of length of tenure. He also heads two important Senate committees – 
			the Committees on Finance and Energy.
		</p>
		<p>
			As Chairman of the Committee on Finance, his major task is the 
			passage of General Appropriations Act annually in the Upper Chamber.
		</p>
		<p>
			As Chairman of the Committee on Energy, he presided over the passage 
			of the following four bills in the Senate regarding the 
			restructuring of the power sector in the 11th Congress.
		</p>
		<p>
			(1)SBN 1712 – Creation of National Transmission Company
		</p>
		<p>
			(2)SBN 1621 – Amending Section 5 of RA 7638 or the Department of 
			Energy Law
		</p>
		<p>
			(3)SBN 1943 – Amending Certain Provisions of EO 172 or the Energy 
			Regulatory Board as Amended by RA 8479
		</p>
		<p>
			(4)SBN 2000 – An Act to Modernize and Reform the Power Industry.
		</p>
		<p>
			These four bills were incorporated in the recent enacted Republic 
			Act 9136 or otherwise known as the Electric Power Industry Reform 
			Act of 2000.
		</p>
		<p>
			A third generation member of the famous Osmeña political clan of 
			Cebu, Sen. John Henry Osmeña has indeed gone a long way as far as 
			his political career is concerned. Starting out as Cebu City 
			Councilor in 1963, he became the Vice-Mayor of the same city in 1968 
			and was elected to the House of Representatives representing the 2nd 
			District the year after.
		</p>
		<p>
			In 1970, he was named as one of the Ten Outstanding Young Men (TOYM) 
			of the country for his exemplary performance in Government Service.
		</p>
		<p>
			At the Miting De Avance of the Liberal Party on Plaza Miranda on 
			August 21, 1971, two grenades exploded one after other, killing 11 
			and leaving scores of people wounded. Both of Sen. Osmeña’s legs 
			were badly injured. Despite all these hardships he was elected to 
			the Senate in 1971.
		</p>
		<p>
			Martial Law cut short his phenomenal political career. Immediately 
			after President Ferdinand Marcos declared martial law on September 
			21, 1971, Sen. Osmeña went on exile in the United States.
		</p>
		<p>
			After the assassination of Senator Benigno “Ninoy” Aquino on August 
			21, 1983, he was the first political exile to return to the country 
			to help in the fight against the Marcos dictatorship.
		</p>
		<p>
			He was appointed officer-in-charge mayor of Cebu City in 11986. He 
			was again elected Senator in 1987 and in 1992. He became the 
			Representative of the 3rd District of Cebu in 1995 before clinching 
			the senatorial post in the 1998 elections.
		</p>
		<p>
			Senator John Henry Osmeña was born on January 17, 1935 to Emilio 
			Osmeña and Ma. Louisa Renner, both of Cebu. He was married to Lucy 
			Urgello with one son, John Gregory Jr., current Vice Governor of 
			Cebu and a former provincial board member from the 3rd District.
		</p>
		<p>
			He earned his mechanical engineering degree from the University of 
			San Carlos and further studies at the University of the Philippines 
			(UP) and the International Social Development Institution in 
			Holland.
