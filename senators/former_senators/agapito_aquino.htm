		<p class="h1_bold">Agapito Aquino</p>
		<p>Senator Butz Aquino 
			has always been cold to politics. He was hesitant to enter this field on 
			the belief that philippine politics was merely elitist, “a ballgame of 
			the rich.” He also did not think much of the system of government saying 
			that it was “ too slow ” in delivering basic services to the people.
		</p>
		<p>
			But all these perceptions took a sudden turnabout 
			upon the death of his brother, Ninoy, a well-known opposition during the 
			Marcos Era. Whereas before he was merely impressed with the sacrifices 
			that Ninoy went through, he now felt that after Ninoy died, he should 
			try to seek justice and continue what his brother had died for. Thus, he 
			helped form the A.T.O.M. (August Twenty-One Movement) and BANDILA 
			(Bansang Nagkakaisa sa Diwa at Layunin) and organized street marches and 
			rallies.
		</p>
		<p>
			His efforts finally came into full bloom with the 
			1986 EDSA REVOLUTION, where Butz was the first figure to publicly exhort 
			people to gather at the Isetann Department Store and march toward the 
			military camps and rally their forces together against the Marcos 
			dictatorship.
		</p>
		<p>
			After two and a half years in the Parliamentary of 
			the streets, Butz took the most decisive step in his political career. 
			He ran for and won a seat in the real parliament – the Senate. 
			Surprisingly enough, instead of becoming hardened by this exposure to 
			the game of politics, Butz still remains an idealist at heart. He has 
			come out as a tireless champion of cooperativism – movement that, 
			according to him, holds the key to solving the country’s most pressing 
			problem, namely, widespread poverty. As a senator of the Republic of the 
			Philippines, he has authored several landmark pieces of legislation, 
			most notably, the Magna Carta for Small Farmers, Seed Act, and the 
			Cooperative Code of the Philippines. This last has contributed greatly 
			to the recent resurgence of Filipino cooperatives. This new law, along 
			with R.A. 6939 (Creating the Cooperative Development Authority) could 
			very well galvanize the cooperative movement into a potent force for 
			socio-economic change.
		</p>
		<p>
			Senator Agapito “Butz” Aquino has emerged as a 
			public servant with his own personal style, vision and conctrete action 
			program towards a better life for the impoverished masses, and has been 
			guided by the princiles of: “Live Simply, Seek Justice, Be Humble, Love 
			Always.”
