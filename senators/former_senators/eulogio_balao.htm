		<p>
			Senator Eulogio Balao was born in Tuguegarao, Cagayan on March 11, 
			1907, to Matias Balao and Praxedes Balauitan. He passed the entrance 
			test to the Philippine Military Academy after graduating from the 
			Tuguegarao High School in 1926. Being too young, he was made to wait 
			for a year, so he enlisted as private in the Philippine 
			Constabulary.
		</p>
		<p>
			He entered the Academy in June 1927 and graduated in 1931. He was 
			assigned as third lieutenant in Laguna, and got wounded in Sta. 
			Rosa, Laguna during the Cental Luzon uprising.
		</p>
		<p>
			Senator Balao was promoted to second lieutenant in 1936, became an 
			instructor at the Philippine Constabulary Academy, and then sent to 
			the Officers School, Fort Bening, Georgia. He was promoted to 
			captain and assigned as executive officer at the 2nd infantry under 
			General Calixto Duque in Mindanao when he returned in 1941. Then he 
			was assigned again as academy instructor.
		</p>
		<p>
			Shortly before war broke out, he was inducted to the USAFFE and made 
			commanding officer of the 11th division’s 11th Infantry Batallion, 
			which he organized, trained and led to battles. His leadership in 
			the Battle of Bessang Pass pocketed General Yamashita’s Japanese 
			Armies.
		</p>
		<p>
			After Liberation, he became a full colonel, and headed campaigns 
			against Huks in Central and Southern Luzon. For his gallantry in 
			action, war heroism, and army experience, he was promoted to deputy 
			chief of staff, and then appointed Secretary of National Defense by 
			President Magsaysay in 1956.
		</p>
		<p>
			He was elected senator in 1957 and served until 1963.
