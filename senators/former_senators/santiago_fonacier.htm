		<p>
			Senator Santiago A. Fonacier was born in Laoag, Ilocos Norte on May 
			21, 1885. He took his elementary education in his town and secondary 
			education in a high school accredited by the University of Santo 
			Tomas and the Liceo de Manila. He studied for the priesthood in a 
			seminary of the Iglesia Filipina Independiente and was ordained 
			priest in 1902.
		</p>
		<p>
			After his ordination, he taught for two years. However, being 
			inclined towards journalism, he left teaching and founded and edited 
			Spanish periodicals, among them La Lucha, which survived from the 
			1900’s to 1941. Thereafter, he became a reporter of La Democracia 
			and El Grito del Pueblo. He did translations into Ilocano of Rizal’s 
			two novels, Noli Me Tangere and El Filibusterismo.
		</p>
		<p>
			In 1912, Fonacier was elected to the first Philippine Assembly as 
			representative of the first district of Ilocos Norte. He served in 
			full his four-year term. In the following election, 1919, he ran and 
			won as senator for the first senatorial district, composed of the 
			provinces of Abra, Batanes, Cagayan Valley, Ilocos Sur, Ilocos Norte 
			and Isabela.
		</p>
		<p>
			Aside from being an assemblyman and senator, he served the 
			government as a member of the Board of Regents of the University of 
			the Philippines, the Philippine Independence mission to the United 
			States, the Institute of National Textbook Board, and served as a 
			military chaplain.
		</p>
		<p>
			Fonacier was one of the original followers of Msgr. Gregorio 
			Aglipay, the famous Filipino clergyman and revolutionary who founded 
			the Iglesia Filipina Independente as a renegade Catholic sect free 
			from the jurisdiction and rules of the Roman Catholic Church and the 
			Vatican itself. He succeeded Aglipay.
		</p>
		<p>
			Bishop Fonacier died at the age of 92 on December 8, 1977. He was 
			married to Carmen Jamias with whom he had eight children.
