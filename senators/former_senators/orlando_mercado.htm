		<p>
			The second of five children of public school teacher Guillermo P. 
			Mercado of Dagami, Leyte and Adriana Sanchez of Bacoor, Cavite, 
			Senator Orly Mercado was born on April 26, 1946. He grew up in the 
			depressed area of Fabie St. in Paco, Manila.
		</p>
		<p>
			A product of the public school system, Orly graduated valedictorian 
			of Celedonio Salvador Elementary School and with honors at the 
			Manuel A. Roxas High School. He was the first public school student 
			to represent the country in 1961 in the New York Mirror Youth Forum 
			in New York, U.S.A.
		</p>
		<p>
			Orly supported his college education by working as a casual laborer 
			at Manila’s City Engineer’s Office and later as a clerk at City 
			Hall. He earned a degree in Bachelor of Arts in Political Science, 
			and later Master of Arts in Communications from the University of 
			the Philippines.
		</p>
		<p>
			Orly got his first break as broadcaster when he landed a job as 
			radio-TV announcer of the Republic Broadcasting System while taking 
			his Political Science course at the State University. He lost that 
			job when he helped organize a labor union that later declared a 
			strike. He then transferred to ABS-CBN where he started as a police 
			reporter. He was later tapped to head and anchor the popular radio 
			program Radio Patrol of ABS-CBN from 1969 to 1971.
		</p>
		<p>
			He distinguished himself with his fearless reportage of contemporary 
			events and hard hitting social commentaries. He was detained in Fort 
			Bonifacio for almost ten months after martial law was declared.
		</p>
		<p>
			Orly produced and hosted the popular Kapwa Ko, Mahal Ko, the 
			country’s longest running public service program helping the 
			indigents and the needy from different parts of the country.
		</p>
		<p>
			For his responsive and relevant broadcast programs he was honored 
			with various citations and awards, including the Ten Outstanding 
			Young Men (TOYM) Awards in 1978 in the field of Public Service 
			Broadcast media.
		</p>
		<p>
			As an educator, Orly was associate professor and head of the 
			Communication Arts Department of Miriam College and University of 
			Santo Tomas.
		</p>
		<p>
			Orly was elected on his first try at national politics to the First 
			Regular Batasang Pambansa as an opposition member of Parliament in 
			Quezon City. He topped the May 14, 1984 elections and bested more 
			seasoned politicians associated with then strongman Ferdinand 
			Marcos.
		</p>
		<p>
			When President Corazon Aquino was swept to power by a 
			civilian-backed military uprising in 1986, Orly was appointed 
			chairman of the national Parks Development Committee which had 
			jurisdiction over Luneta or Rizal Park.
		</p>
		<p>
			During his first term, Orly was Majority Floorleader and chairman of 
			the Senate Committee on Trade and Commerce Act of the Philippines 
			(RA 7394), Generics Act of 1988 (RA 6675), An Act Establishing 
			Provincial Centers for Science and Technology (RA 6959), and the 
			Magna Carta for Disabled Persons (RA 7277). In the last Congress, 
			the bills he authored which became laws include: National Blood 
			Services Act (RA 7719), An Act Granting Permanent Resident Status to 
			Veterans (RA 7837), Barangay Health Workers Incentives (RA 7883), 
			and the AFP Modernization Act (RA 7898).

			He headed the Senate Committee on National Defense and Security and 
			the Committee on Science and Technology. He was also vice chairman 
			of the Senate Committee on Finance, Natural Resources, Public 
			Services, Health and Demography. He was a member of the Commission 
			on Appointments (CA) and was Assistant Majority Leader in both the 
			Senate and the CA.
		</p>
		<p>
			He was senator for three (3 terms): 1987-1992, 1992-1995 and 
			1995-1998. As an environmentalist, he struggled for the preservation 
			of the country’s natural resources and the protection of the 
			environment. He was the principal author of a bill seeking a total 
			ban on commercial logging to arrest forest destruction and to give 
			mother nature time to regenerate its forests.
		</p>
		<p>
			For championing the cause of the environmentalists, Orly was chosen 
			to chair the Green Coalition, a non-stock environmental advocacy 
			non-governmental organization (NGO).
		</p>
		<p>
			He represented the Congress in the UNCED Earth Summit held in Rio de 
			Janeiro in 1992 and was an active member of the Parliamentarians for 
			Global Action based in New York.
		</p>
		<p>
			He was secretary of the Department of National Defense and Security 
			under the leadership of President Estrada.
		</p>
		<p>
			Orly was married to the late Dorothy Jane Douglas with whom he has 
			three children, and remarried to Dra. Susie Pineda. As a martial 
			arts practitioner he is a black belter in arnis with the rank of 
			Lakan.
