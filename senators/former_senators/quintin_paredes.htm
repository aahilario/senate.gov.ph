		<p>
			Lawyer, legislator, and statesman, Quintin Paredes was born to Juan 
			Felix Paredes and Regine Babila in Bangued, Abra on September 9, 
			1884. He obtained his elementary education at the school his father 
			had established. He also studied at the Colegio Seminario de Vigan

			Escuela de Leyes. He had degrees in Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of

			designated Deputy Fiscal of the City of Manila in 1908, and he was 
			promoted to the position of First Assistant City Fiscal in 1930. He 
			also taught criminal law at the Escuela de Derecho from 1909 to 
			1911, and served as its director from 1911 to 1917.

			became Manila City Fiscal. When the municipal government was 
			reorganized the following year, he was asked to join the Bureau of 
			Justice. In 1918, he was named Attorney General. Two years later, in 
			1920, he was designated Secretary of Justice, and served in this 
			distinguished office until 1921, when he returned to private 
			practice.

			Paredes joined the parliamentary mission to the United States in 
			1919. While there, he practiced his profession in the U.S. Supreme

			his feat years later in the 1955 elections. At the Senate, he was 
			voted, initially, President Pro-Tempore, and later as Senate 
			President. His industriousness and perseverance made him a most 
			efficient and dedicated public official, thereby instituting a more 
			effective Senate during his term. He retired from public service at 
			the age of 79 in 1963 and served as president and vice–chairman of 
			the General Bank and Trust Company. He died on January 30, 1973.
