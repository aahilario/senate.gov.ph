			Congress adjourned February 9, he became the Senate Minority Leader 
			Floor Leader, making him an ex-officio member of all Senate

			and finish the trial within 60 days. A strong exponent of the rights 
			of the consuming public, he filed Resolution No. 579 and fought for 
			the ban on collection of parking fees by shopping malls. The Senate

			provisions of the waiver of liability, stated in parking tickets are 
			illegal.

			dispense with the tedious and expensive judicial process where the 
			interested party has to hire the services of a lawyer and bear the 
			cost of lengthy litigation.
		</p>
		<p>
			As vanguard of truth, during the historic impeachment trial of 
			former President Estrada, he was one of the ten Senator-Judges who 
			courageously voted for the opening of the second envelope, an event 
			that triggered People Power II, which eventually led to the ouster 
			of the former president.

			alleviating poverty.
