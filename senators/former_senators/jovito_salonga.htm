		<p>
			Reputed as "The Nation’s Fiscalizer", Jovito 
			Salonga’s distinguished record as Congressman for 
			the 2nd District of Rizal later won for him the 
			overwhelming mandate of the Filipino electorate as 
			he consistently topped three Senatorial elections 
			despite lack of material means and at against all 
			odds – a record without precedent in Philippine 
			political history, in addition to the remarkable 
			fact that he was elected under three different 
			administrations ( that of Macapagal, Marcos and 
			Aquino ). Salonga was chosen as one of the most 
			outstanding Senators with his significant 
			legislations, some of which inspired public 
			interest: the State Scholarship Law, the Disclosure 
			of Interest Act, the Magna Carta for Public School 
			Teachers, and the Code of Conduct and Ethical 
			Standards for Public Officials and Employees, and 
			the Act Defining and Penalizing the Crime of 
			Plunder.
		</p>
		<p>
			Salonga has been fighting corruption and 
			dictatorship since his youth. The son of a 
			Presbyterian minister from Rizal province, he joined 
			the resistance movement during the Japanese 
			occupation, was captured, tortured and sentenced by 
			a military court to years of hard labor.
		</p>
		<p>
			Released in 1943, he topped the bar examinations the 
			following year and made plans to attend Harvard for 
			his master’s degree. He followed up his master’s at 
			Harvard with a doctorate from Yale University, but 
			turned down a faculty position there because he felt 
			he should take part in post-war reconstruction in 
			the Philippines.
		</p>
		<p>
			Upon his return, he embarked on a career that 
			quickly established him as one of the most brilliant 
			lawyers in the country. He taught law at leading 
			universities in Manila, and authored several tax 
			texts that are used here and abroad.
		</p>
		<p>
			When Martial Law was declared in 1972, he was one of 
			its most outspoken opponents. He defended political 
			prisoners who challenged the Marcos regime.
		</p>
		<p>
			In October 1980, after the bombing of the Asian 
			Society of Travel Agents’ conference at the PICC, 
			Salonga was arrested along with several others and 
			was detained without investigation and without 
			charges.
		</p>
		<p>
			After his release from military custody, he was 
			offered a visiting scholarship at Yale, where he 
			engaged in the revision of his book on International 
			Law. He completed his book on the Marcos years and a 
			program for a new democratic Philippines.
		</p>
		<p>
			Salonga returned to the Philippines on January 21, 
			1985 and when the Aquino government took over after 
			the People Power Revolution of February 1986, 
			Salonga was named chairman of the Presidential 
			Commission on Good Government, which was tasked with 
			investigating and recovering the ill-gotten wealth 
			of the members of the past regime.
		</p>
		<p>
			With his selfless dedication to duty and his 
			significant contributions to the country, Jovito 
			Salonga continues to serve as brilliant inspiration 
			to all Filipinos.
