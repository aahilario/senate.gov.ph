		<p>
			Ferdinand E. Marcos was born on September 11, 1917 in Sarrat, Ilocos 
			Norte. His parents, Mariano Marcos and Josefa Edralin, were both 
			teachers.
		</p>
		<p>
			From 1923 to 1929, he attended the Sarrat Central School, Shamrock 
			Elementary School in Laoag and the Ermita Elementary School in 
			Manila. He finished high school and liberal arts course at the 
			University of the Philippines. While still a student, he was 
			commissioned as third lieutenant (apprentice officer) in the 
			Philippine Constabulary Reserve after having been an ROTC battalion 
			commander.
		</p>
		<p>
			In 1935, Assemblyman Julio Nalundasan, a political rival of his 
			father, was shot dead. Suspicion for the crime fell on the Marcoses. 
			Ferdinand Marcos who was arrested on a charge of conspiracy to 
			murder, was tried, and found guilty in 1939. He argued his case on 
			appeal to the Supreme Court, luckily winning an acquittal a year 
			later.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the summer of 1939 he received his bachelors degree, cum laude 
			from the U.P. College of Law. He would have been a class 
			valedictorian and magna cum laude had he not been imprisoned for the 
			Nalundasan murder. The case prevented him from attending several 
			weeks of classes. He reviewed for the bar examinations while in 
			prison. He bailed himself out in order to take the examination, 
			where he emerged topnotcher in November of the same year. He became 
			trial lawyer in Manila.
		</p>
		<p>
			During World War II, he served as an officer in the Armed Forces of 
			the Philippines.
		</p>
		<p>
			As a lawyer and a master politician, Marcos led a most a interesting 
			and controversial political career both before and after his term as 
			Senate President. He became Senator after he served as member of the 
			House of Representatives for three terms, then later as Minority 
			Floor Leader before gaining the Senate Presidency. He is one of the 
			legislators who had established a record for having introduced a 
			number of significant bills, many of which found their way into the 
			Republic statute books.
		</p>
		<p>
			He was elected President of the Philippines in 1965 and was 
			reelected in 1969. On September 21, 1972, Marcos imposed martial law 
			and he stayed in power until 1986, after the historic four-day “ 
			People Power ” revolution at EDSA. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Marcos went on exile in Hawaii, where he died on September 28, 1989. 
			He left behind his wife, Imelda and their three children: Maria 
			Imelda Josefa Trinidad (Imee), Ferdinand Jr. (Bongbong), and Irene 
			Victoria.
		</p>
		<p>
			Thus far, he is the last Senate President to become President of the 
			Philippines.
