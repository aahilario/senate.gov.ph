		<p>
			Teodoro Sandiko was born in the district of Pandacan, Manila on 
			March 31, 1860 to Miguel Sandiko and Maria Paz Santa Ana.
		</p>
		<p>
			He first learned his alphabet at home and began his formal education 
			under Capitan Manuel de Pandacan, then continued his first second 
			years in Latin lessons at the school of Vicente Quirino. He pursued 
			his third year studies in the school of Quintin Salvidea and his 
			fourth year under the Jesuits in Manila. Subsequently, he 
			transferred to the University of Santo Tomas where he obtained his 
			Bachelor of Arts in 1886. He had two years of law, but he opted to 
			concentrate on teaching Latin in a school of Malolos rather than 
			finish the course.
		</p>
		<p>
			With his progressive ideas, he incurred the ire of the Spaniards, 
			particularly of the ecclesiastical authorities and to escape 
			persecution, he left for Hongkong and proceeded to Spain where he 
			continued his law studies at the University of Madrid. He managed La 
			Solidaridad, a patriotic newspaper founded by Graciano Lopez Jaena 
			on February 15, 1889, which later became the mouthpiece of the 
			Filipino propaganda movement.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the Revolutionary Government of General Emilio Aguinaldo, he held 
			various positions: Director of the Secretaria de Relaciones 
			Exteriores, colonel of the Estado Mayor and brigadier general of the 
			Revolutionary government.
		</p>
		<p>
			He resigned from his job and became Secretary of Interior on January 
			2, 1899 and General of the First Philippine Republic. He entered 
			politics and was twice elected governor of Bulacan and attended the 
			first conventions of governor’s in Manila on October 23, 1906.
		</p>
		<p>
			He was elected Senator representing the third senatorial district 
			comprising the province of Tarlac, Nueva Ecija, Pampanga and Bulacan 
			from 1919 to 1931. As a Senator he became popular in the Senate for 
			his political conviction and was dubbed “ Constructive 
			Oppositionist” and he became a member of the commission for 
			independence in 1921 and 1922.
		</p>
		<p>
			During the 1934 to 1935 Constitutional Convention, he was elected 
			delegate of the first district of Bulacan and elected Second 
			Vice-President on July 1934 at the House of Representatives.
		</p>
		<p>
			After retiring from public life he became the manager of two cigas 
			factories: Katubusan and La Paz y Buen Viaje.
		</p>
		<p>
			He died on October 19, 1939.
