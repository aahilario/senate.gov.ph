		<p class="h1_bold">Eulogio A. Rodriguez, Sr.</p>
		<p>
			Eulogio “Amang” Rodriguez was born in Montalban, Rizal on January 
			21, 1883. He was the eldest son of Petronilo Rodriguez and Monica 
			Adona. He had seven children by his first wife, Juana Santiago, 
			namely Eulogio, Jr., Jose, Ruperto, Leonor, Isidro, Constancio and 
			Adelaida. With his second wife, Luisita Canoy, he had three 
			children, namely, Baby, Linda and Rafael.
		</p>
		<p>
			“Amang” as he was popularly called, first studied at the Spanish-run 
			public school in Montalban, Rizal, then took his secondary course at 
			the San Juan de Letran in Manila, where he completed his Bachelor of 
			Arts in 1896.
		</p>
		<p>
			Eulogio “Amang” Rodriguez was Municipal President of Montalban, 
			Rizal from 1906-1916; became Governor of Rizal in June 1916; and was 
			reelected in June 1922. He was appointed Mayor of Manila by Governor 
			General Leonard Wood on July 23, 1923, and later served as 
			Representative of Nueva Vizcaya District from February 1924 to May 
			1925. He became the Representative of the Second District of Rizal 
			in 1925 and was reelected in 1931 and 1934. He was also appointed 
			Secretary of Agriculture and Commerce by Governor Frank Murphy on 
			July 26, 1934, re-appointed by President Manuel Quezon on January 
			15, 1940, and served as such until August 28, 1941. After his 
			resignation as Mayor of Manila, he campaigned for a seat in the 
			Senate and was elected senator in 1941. On May 20, 1953, he was 
			elected Senate President, a position he occupied for the next ten 
			years.
		</p>
		<p>
			“Amang” started his career in politics as a Democrata or a member of 
			the opposition party, and not until there was a general realignment 
			of parties due to the divisive struggle over the approval of the 
			Independence Law in 1933, did he switch to the majority or the 
			Nacionalista Party, to which he remained faithful until the day of 
			his death three decades later. He nursed the party during its 
			darkest hours, and steered it successfully through the political 
			reefs and typhoons that rocked the local scene, thus earning for him 
			the sobriquet “Mr. Nacionalista”. Unlike so many others, he did not 
			switch parties for personal convenience.
		</p>
		<p>
			As a legislator, he always supported measures improving the lot of 
			common man, for he knew that the upgrading of the masses was the 
			best way of retaining democracy in the country. Many were sometimes 
			politically at odds with him, but they always found him to be a 
			reasonable opponent who played clean in a game known for its 
			mendacity and unpricipled moves. A man of integrity, who played fair 
			even with his opponents, and who could be generous in victory, 
			Eulogio “Amang” Rodriguez was a man, a politician and a public 
			official of sterling attributes.
