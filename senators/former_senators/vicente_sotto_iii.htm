		<p class="h1_bold">Vicente C. Sotto III</p>
		<p>
			Since its inauguration on October 16, 1916, the membership of the 
			Philippine Senate has been composed of brilliant, dynamic and 
			independent-minded men and women with their mandate directly coming 
			from the people. It is therefore a distinct honor and privilege for 
			Senator Vicente C. Sotto III to be part of this august chamber in 
			the Ninth (9th), Tenth (10th), Eleventh (11th) and Twelfth (12th) 
			Congress of the Philippines.
		</p>
		<p>
			The destined rise of Senator Vicente C. Sotto III from the 
			Vice-Mayoralty position of Quezon City to the Philippine Senate 
			began in 1988 when he ran and won in a landslide victory 
			unprecedented in the history of Quezon City. As Vice-Mayor, he was 
			the presiding officer of the Quezon City Council. He founded the 
			Vice-Mayors League of the Philippines and became its first President 
			and was eventually elected President Emeritus of the League. It was 
			during this term that his pursuit of a drug-free Philippines took 
			form. Because of his crusade to protect the youth against illegal 
			drugs from its pernicious effects, Senator Sotto was named National 
			Vice-Chairman of the Citizen&#39;s Drugwatch. He was likewise awarded 
			twice the International Award of Honor by the International 
			Narcotics Enforcement Officers Association in Florida and 
			California, U.S.A.
		</p>
		<p>
			1992 marked the year when he entered national politics by 
			overwhelmingly topping the Senatorial Elections. He acquired a total 
			of 11,792,121 votes, a phenomenal achievement for a political 
			neophyte. He is the third Sotto in the family to become part of the 
			Philippine Senate. Before him were his granduncle Senator Filemon 
			Sotto, acknowledged during his time as one of the Seven (7) Wise Men 
			of the Philippine Assembly who served from 1916-1922 and his 
			grandfather Senator Vicente Yap Sotto of Cebu, a maverick senator 
			and author of the Press Freedom Law, who served from 1946-1953.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Senator Sotto of the 9th and 10th Congress (1992 - 1998)</b>
		</p>
		<p>
			During his first term, Senator Vicente C. Sotto III served as 
			Assistant Majority Floor Leader and Chairman of the Senate 
			Committees on Local Government and Tourism. He also assumed the 
			Chairmanship of the Senate Committees on Youth and Sports 
			Development; Illegal Drugs; and Rural Development. He was also a 
			member of the Commission on Appointments.
		</p>
		<p>
			Senator Sotto has successfully sponsored and steered the passage of 
			sixty-one (61) Senate bills as principal sponsor during the Ninth 
			(9th) Tenth (10th) Congress.
		</p>
		<p>
			These measures include the conversion of a total of twenty-five (25) 
			municipalities into cities such as the cities of Makati, Marikina, 
			Pasig, Parañaque, Muntinlupa and others located in various parts of 
			our country. The increase of cityhood bills after the delivery of 
			Republic Act No. 7160, otherwise known as the Local Government Code 
			of 1991, confirmed the effectiveness of the concept of local 
			autonomy as a viable strategy and vehicle towards progress and 
			development. It is expected that the conversion of municipalities 
			into cities will bring in more income to the local government units 
			through greater share in the internal revenue allotment (IRA), and 
			new sources of revenues as new cities&#39; endeavor meet the growing 
			demands for a better and more efficient delivery of basic public 
			services.
		</p>
		<p>
			Senator Sotto was also responsible for the passage of several bills, 
			which provided for the establishment of tourist zones in our 
			country, considered vital to the promotion and advancement of our 
			tourism industry towards international standards.
		</p>
		<p>
			With much needed reforms in our country&#39;s electoral process, Senator 
			Sotto also filed a bill on absentee voting, which is one of the 
			mandates of the Constitution left unheeded. This bill seeks to 
			provide the mechanism for the registration of qualified Filipinos 
			abroad in order for them to exercise their right to vote.
		</p>
		<p>
			A conscientious lawmaker, Senator Sotto was one of the only five 
			senators who voted against the ratification of the General Agreement 
			on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) amidst strong pressures from various 
			sectors.
		</p>
		<p>
			His genuine concern for the welfare of the Filipino youth expanded 
			the horizon of Senator Sotto when he authored two books &quot; Vision for 
			a Drug-Free Philippines&quot; and &quot;The Filipino: Values and Vision&quot;, 
			reflecting his dream and aspirations in building a better society. 
			The two books clearly revealed the visionary character of Senator 
			Sotto an his sincere desire to have a better Philippines for the 
			future generation.
		</p>
		<p>
			Senator Sotto&#39;s legislative record shows a deep commitment to the 
			youth and the underprivileged, as well as, to the upliftment of the 
			basic public services and the progress and development of the 
			country.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Senator Sotto of the 11th Congress (1998 - 2001)</b>
		</p>
		<p>
			In 1998, the Filipino people gave Senator Vicente C. Sotto III a 
			fresh mandate when they elected him number one among the 
			re-electionist senators. This gave Senator Sotto the opportunity to 
			pursue and continue his commitment to the people to address and 
			actively act on the problems confronting the country within the 
			scope of his duty and influence as a senator.
		</p>
		<p>
			At the onset of the 11th Congress, Senator Sotto was assigned the 
			Chairmanship of the Senate Committees on Public Services which 
			handles all matters affecting public services and utilities; 
			communications; land, river, and sea transportation including 
			railroads; inter-island navigation; and lighthouses; and the grant 
			or amendment of legislative franchises. He also chaired the Senate 
			Committee on Science and Technology, which handles all matters 
			relating to science and technology including scientific and 
			technological, development and advancement. Senator Sotto filed a 
			total of one hundred ninety (190) legislative bills encompassing a 
			wide range of concerns that affect the nation.
		</p>
		<p>
			As Chairman of the Senate Committee on Public Services, Senator 
			Sotto tackled major issues assigned to his Committee. One of the 
			first legislation enacted into law in the 11th Congress, Republic 
			Act No. 8750, also known as the Seats Belts Use Act of 1999,” also 
			emanated from his Committee. The Senate Committee on Public Services 
			conducted a total of thirty-six (36) public hearing addressing major 
			issues like the Princess of the Orient maritime tragedy, the 
			Philippine Airlines controversy, interconnection, the cable 
			industry, and issues confronting the telecommunications industry, 
			among others. These came side by side with the tedious deliberations 
			of legislative franchises applications. The Senate Committee on 
			Public Services has approved a total of thirty-nine (39) legislative 
			franchises vital to our country&#39;s industrialization and attempt for 
			modernization.
		</p>
		<p>
			Senator Sotto during his tenure as Chairman of the Senate Committee 
			on Science and Technology, filed Philippine Senate Resolution No. 86 
			directing the appropriate Senate Committees to make an inquiry, in 
			aid of legislation, the impact on the computer industry and possible 
			problems arising from the &#39;millennium bug&#39; or &#39;Y2K bug&#39; and the 
			preparations which are being undertaken in anticipation thereof with 
			the coming of the year 2000. He then co-authored and led the 
			Committee to deliberate on Senate Bill No. 1505 that led to the 
			enactment of Republic Act Number 8747, entitled “An Act requiring 
			disclosure of Year 2000 statements and readiness of computer-based 
			systems and products, providing funds therefore, for other purposes” 
			that prepared the country to cope with the Y2K bug threat.
		</p>
		<p>
			In spite of his busy schedule as Chairman of the Senate Committee on 
			Public Services, Senator Sotto continued his advocacy against the 
			proliferation of illegal drugs by filing a number of bills 
			addressing this menace plaguing the country. He filed several bills 
			covering the different aspects to curb the drug problem. Senate Bill 
			No. 383 entitled “An Act creating a Presidential Drug Enforcement 
			Agency” is an organizational approach to control and eventually 
			eliminate the drug problem by creating an agency that will focus on 
			the coordination of the different anti-drug entities and the 
			implementation of government policies addressing the drug problem. 
			Senate Bill No. 384 entitled “An Act providing for the inclusion of 
			“methamphetamine hydrochloride” commonly known as “shabu” under the 
			classification of dangerous and prohibited drugs,” on the other 
			hand, is a direct approach to ban certain substances prone to abuse.
		</p>
		<p>
			Senator Sotto is a proactive advocate for the modernization of the 
			telecommunications sector in the country. He filed a number of 
			Senate Bills addressing the common problems besetting the 
			telecommunications sector today like Senate Bill No. 1660 entitled 
			“An Act mandating interconnection between and among public 
			telecommunications entities” and Senate Bill No. 2084 entitled &quot;An 
			Act providing a service area scheme to all internet service 
			providers (ISPs), liberalizing the granting of its operational 
			license to offer expanded services and deploy internet broadband 
			infrastructure and for other purposes.&quot;
		</p>
		<p>
			A pragmatic nationalist who envisions a country free from the 
			dictates of violence and internal threats, Senator Sotto voted for 
			the approval of the Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA), opening a new 
			era of military cooperation between the Philippines and the United 
			States of America. At the height of the issue concerning the 
			proposal of some sectors to change the Philippine National Anthem, 
			Senator Sotto delivered a privilege speech in defense of the 
			existing anthem citing it as a fundamental symbol of our sovereign 
			nation.
		</p>
		<p>
			To further enhance his knowledge and competency in public 
			governance, Senator Sotto embarked in an Executive program for 
			Leaders in Development at the Harvard University John F. Kennedy 
			School of Government and completed it in June 2000.
		</p>
		<p>
			Senator Sotto likewise served as Vice-Chairman of the Senate 
			Committee on Finance and handled the deliberations of the annual 
			budget of the Office of the President, Congress of the Philippines 
			and the Department of Health. As a member of the majority party in 
			the 11th Congress, he was also kept busy as the Assistant Majority 
			Leader guiding and facilitating the deliberations and debates in the 
			august Chamber.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Senator Sotto of the 12th Congress (2001 2004)</b>
		</p>
		<p>
			Now in his final three years, Senator Vicente C. Sotto III continues 
			his hard work and education through his experiences and challenges 
			in the Senate halls. From a neophyte senator who faced the immense 
			pressure from the prying eyes of critics and expectations of his 
			colleagues, Senator Sotto has proven his mettle and has earned the 
			respect and trust of the other senators and most importantly, the 
			Filipino people. He is now considered as one of the senior 
			legislators in the Senate and is looked upon for guidance by his new 
			Senator-peers trying to grasp the dynamics of the Philippine Senate.
		</p>
		<p>
			Senator Sotto has always been an advocate for a drug-free 
			Philippines, for a more efficient local government, for a modern 
			information technology, and for a well-represented citizenry in 
			government. He has filed one hundred and twenty six (126) Senate 
			Bills and two (2) Senate Resolutions in the 12th Congress of the 
			Republic of the Philippines.
		</p>
		<p>
			Senator Sotto is currently one of the Assistant Minority Floor 
			Leaders by virtue of his seniority and clear grasp of various issues 
			and is a member of the Senate Electoral Tribunal.
		</p>
		<p>
			His balanced and all-sided approach in addressing the wide gamut of 
			problems facing our country reflects the maturity Senator Sotto has 
			reached in the realm of legislation and public service. Amidst the 
			lure of self-importance and arrogance particular to the nature of 
			Philippine politics, Senator Sotto has maintained his humble 
			disposition and selfless dedication maintaining close contact with 
			the Filipino masses he swore to serve.
		</p>
		<p>
			Serving his last three years in the Philippine Senate, Vicente C. 
			Sotto III has reached far in his endeavors, but the peak of higher 
			mountains in the distance still awaits him.

			well-known composer, actor and musical artist. He was a prime mover 
			in the irreversible trend toward the popularity of the Filipino

			he was the Vice-President for production of the Vicor Group of 
			Companies. Among his popular compositions is the song Magkaisa, 
			considered the anthem of the 1986 People Power Revolution.

			programs, he co-hosted the longest running program in Philippine 
			history Eat Bulaga. The Senator also hosted Brigada Siete, a public 
			affairs program that has garnered citations and trophies from 
			renowned award-giving bodies.
