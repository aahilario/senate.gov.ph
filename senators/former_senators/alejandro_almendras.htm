		<p>
			Senator Alejandro D. Almendras was born in Danao, Cebu on February 27, 
			1919. At the time of his birth, his father, the late Paulo Almendras, 
			was already a politician of note and one of the trusted leaders of 
			former President Sergio Osmena, Sr., founder of the Nacionalista Party. 
			The elder Almendras was the mayor of Danao for four consecutive terms. 
			Almendras’ mother, Elisea Durano, was the older sister of Rep. Ramon 
			Durano.
		</p>
		<p>
			Almendras graduated from the Cebu Provincial High School in 1938 and 
			enrolled at the Far Eastern University in Manila to take up aeronautical 
			engineering. In 1941, however, his studies were disrupted when he was 
			called to active service by the armed forces.
		</p>
		<p>
			During the war, Almendras served with the Philippine Air Force and when 
			the USAFFE forces surrendered, he returned to his home province where he 
			helped organize the resistance movement. Because of his skill, 
			leadership and courage in those dark days of the Japanese occupation, 
			Almendras, then 23 years of age, was given command of the 88th Infantry 
			Regiment by Col. James Cushing, Cebu Area Command Commander, with the 
			rank of lieutenant colonel. For his valiant service during the war 
			years. Almendras received numerous awards and decorations. He was 
			awarded “Most Outstanding Veteran” in 1958.
		</p>
		<p>
			Almendras was a third-year law student at the Mindanao Colleges in Davao 
			City in 1951 when politics finally caught up with him.
		</p>
		<p>
			Pitted against a seasoned Liberal Party incumbent supported by the 
			administration, Almendras won his first political battle and was elected 
			governor of Davao, the youngest governor in the country at that time. He 
			ran and won again in 1955.
		</p>
		<p>
			During his incumbency as governor, Almendras rid the provincial 
			government of graft and corruption. As governor, he built more roads, 
			schoolhouses, artesian wells and other public improvements than all his 
			predecessors combined. He helped improve the agricultural economy of 
			Davao which minimized the community’s social problems. In 1958, he was 
			conferred the award as the most “Outstanding Governor” on the basis of 
			honesty, integrity, efficiency and road building by the foreign 
			correspondents’ Association of the Philippines.
		</p>
		<p>
			On May 8, 1959, he was appointed first secretary of the Department of 
			General Services by President Garcia. He organized the department with 
			strict supervision over the acquisition of materials, equipment and 
			supplies. He was awarded as the “Most Outstanding Cabinet Member” by the 
			Confederation of Filipino Veterans early in February, 1959.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the same year, he was elected and served as senator until 1972. He 
			was credited for the passage into law of Republic Act 3018 nationalizing 
			the rice and corn industry as well as the law creating the Veterans 
			Bank.
		</p>
		<p>
			Senator Almendras was married to the former Caridad Cabahug of Borbon, 
			Cebu. They were blessed with seven children. He died at age 76 in August 
			1995.
