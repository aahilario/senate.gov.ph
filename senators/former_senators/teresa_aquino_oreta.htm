		<p>
			“Education is the key to the improvement of the quality of life of 
			Filipinos.”
		</p>
		<p>
			This is the truism Senator Teresa “TAO” Aquino Oreta maintained as 
			Chairperson of the Senate Committee on Education, Arts and Culture 
			of the 11th Congress, and still maintains even as she handles a 
			different committee in the 12th Congress. It is with this principle 
			that Senator Aquino Oreta has vigorously sought to improve the 
			employment status, working conditions, and welfare benefits of 
			public school teachers.
		</p>
		<p>
			“I want to take care of the teacher so that the teacher in turn will 
			take care of our children, so in turn our children will take care of 
			the future of the country,” she has often said.
		</p>
		<p>
			The youngest of the prominent Aquino’s of Tarlac, she carries with 
			her the strong family tradition of nationalism and activism.
		</p>
		<p>
			Senator Aquino Oreta finished her primary school at the College of 
			Holy Spirit in Mendiola and finished high school at Assumption 
			College. She then took up Literature and history at the Assumption 
			Convent and received her International Studies degree in Cuidad 
			Ducal, Avila, Spain. She became a Lieutenant Colonel (Reserved) in 
			the Philippine Air Force after earning a Master’s Degree in National 
			Security Administration from the National Defense College of the 
			Philippines.
		</p>
		<p>
			She is married to businessman Antolin M. Oreta Jr., and they have 
			been blessed with four children – Rissa, Len, Karmela and Lorenzo.
		</p>
		<p>
			Before being elected to the Senate, she already made her mark as a 
			legislator in the House of Representatives for three consecutive 
			terms, from 1987-1998, representing the district of Malabon-Navotas. 
			Even then, she already focused on issues concerning education, women 
			and children, livelihood and employment, food and health, as well as 
			the improvement of public facilities in Malabon and the nation in 
			general.
		</p>
		<p>
			At the Lower House, she authored, and co-authored about 280 bills 
			(79 were enacted into laws) and proposed 101 local and national 
			resolutions (20 were adopted). Senator Aquino Oreta became Assistant 
			Majority Floor Leader twice: First during the 8th Congress in 1987 
			and the second, during the 10th Congress in 1995. In so doing, she 
			became the first woman Assistant Majority Floor Leader in the 
			history of the Lower House.
		</p>
		<p>
			A strong advocate of women’s health empowerment, she authored 
			Republic Act 6864 eventually led to the creation of the MAKATAO 
			Center for Women Center / San Lorenzo District Hospital for women in 
			Malabon in March 1998. The center and hospital seek to provide 
			integrated health services, health education and counseling.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the 1998 National Elections, she was elected senator under the 
			LAMMP (Laban ng Makabayang Pilipino) banner.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the three years she has been in office, Senator Aquino Oreta had 
			filed 197 Senate Bills (authored and co-authored) and resolutions, 
			related to education, youth, women, family relations, health, local 
			governments, trade and commerce, foreign relations, agriculture, 
			agrarian reform, justice, public works, human rights, cooperatives, 
			labor, mass media, electoral reforms, government service, 
			environment, rural development, finance, public order and illegal 
			drugs, and many other concerns.
		</p>
		<p>
			Senator Aquino Oreta is guided by her Seven-Point-Agenda which 
			accounts for her thrusts in the legislature:
		</p>
		<p>
			The Filipino Child First. “We need to guarantee that the Filipino 
			child will be nurtured in an environment conducive to infant 
			survival, growth and physical development.”
		</p>
		<p>
			Caring for Our Teachers. “No education reform will succeed unless it 
			is a reform of the teaching-learning process and is focused on 
			helping the teacher become a better teacher.”
		</p>
		<p>
			Governing Basic Education. “Promulgate instead a policy framework 
			for the governance of basic education which shall adhere to a 
			principle of shared governance, the adoption of decentralized system 
			of basic education and the establishment of opportunities for local 
			school initiatives.”
		</p>
		<p>
			Modernizing Education. “The new age of learning will bring fresh 
			views, new looks and different shapes of schooling and schools.”
		</p>
		<p>
			Universalizing Literacy. “It is easy to be self-complacent with very 
			high literacy rates that are officially reported to be 94%. Yet it 
			is disturbing to know that the other side of this so-called 
			‘achievement’ is the fact that almost 11 million Filipinos have very 
			poor or even no literacy and numeracy skills at all.”
		</p>
		<p>
			Rationalizing Tertiary Education. “I am alarmed with statistics that 
			only 16.2 of every 100 students in both public and private schools 
			who began in Grade 1 in any given schools year subsequently reached 
			4th year college. What immediately comes to my mind with such 
			discouraging figures are not the faces of those who made it but 
			rather of those who did not. When 83.8 of 100 students do not 
			survive one wonders if this reflects a failure of the students or of 
			a system of education that over the years has become both 
			ineffective and inefficient.”
		</p>
		<p>
			Policy Research. “There is a need to look for data about education 
			legislation in order to make sure that they are implemented and that 
			they benefit our learners.”
		</p>
		<p>
			Some of her bills that have been signed into law during the 11th 
			Congress include:
		</p>
		<p>
			R.A. 8980 – Early Childhood Care and Development Act
		</p>
		<p>
			R.A. 8972 – Solo Parent Act
		</p>
		<p>
			R.A. 9053 – Philippine Landscape Architecture Act
		</p>
		<p>
			R.A. 8976 – Philippine Micronutrient Fortification Program
		</p>
		<p>
			R.A. 9003 – Solid Waste Management Act
		</p>
		<p>
			R.A. 8749 – Clean Air Act
		</p>
		<p>
			R.A. 8976 – Food Fortification Act
		</p>
		<p>
			R.A. 8792 – E-Commerce Act
		</p>
		<p>
			R.A. 9105 – Art Authentication Act
		</p>
		<p>
			R.A. 9036 – Philippine Science High School System Act
		</p>
		<p>
			R.A. 9155 – Governance of Basic Education Act
		</p>
		<p>
			Early 1999, Project TAO, for Teachers’ Advancement for Optimum 
			Well-being, was launched. This is the nationwide survey of the 
			employment status, working conditions, and welfare benefits of 
			public school teachers – the most comprehensive study of its kind in 
			the history of the Philippine education. It is meant to give a face 
			and a name for every statistical data on teachers for any given 
			locality. The database has already been completed and turned over to 
			the Department of Education, Culture and Sports for them to 
			periodically update and improve on where necessary.
		</p>
		<p>
			The success of this undertaking is being parlayed to another study 
			on the computer readiness of all primary and secondary schools, 
			public and private, (Project TAO CARES) with the end view of 
			interconnecting them with the DECS Central Office database. Also, 
			school heads, principals and schools division superintendents were 
			trained in the effective administration of schools (Project TAO 
			LEADS) in direct response to the Project TAO findings, as well as 
			the changing needs of the school environment.
		</p>
		<p>
			Senator Aquino Oreta is also responsible for enabling the issuance 
			of pay slips for public school teachers for the first time in August 
			2000. This she pushed for, immediately upon learning that the 
			teachers were kept in the dark of any deductions from their salaries 
			by the simple absence of this basic document.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Senator strives to be in constant touch with her constituents 
			particularly through her radio program, “Usapang TAO sa RMN” which 
			is aired from 7:00 to 8:00 am every Sunday over DZXL (558 KHz) 
			Manila, DYHB (74.7 KHz) Bacolod, DXCC (828 KHz) Cagayan de Oro, DYHP 
			(612 MHz) Cebu, DXDC (621 KHz) Davao, DWNX (91.1 MHz) Naga, DYMY 
			(729 KHz) Cotabato, DYMD (1152 KHz) General Santos, and DXRZ (900 
			KHz) Zamboanga.
