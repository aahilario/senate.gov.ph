		<p>
			Senator Isabelo delos Reyes was born in Vigan, Ilocos Sur, on July 
			7, 1864 to Elias de los Reyes and Leona Florentino.
		</p>
		<p>
			He acquired his early education in the Seminary of Vigan. The cruel 
			discipline imposed by the friar-professors and their arrogance and 
			bigotry inflamed his rebellious spirit so that he came to have a 
			lifelong for frailocracy.
		</p>
		<p>
			In 1880, at the age of 16, he went to Manila and enrolled in the 
			College of San Juan de Letran. Two years later, on his eighteenth 
			birthday on July 7, 1882, his father died. After receiving the 
			degree of Bachelor of Arts from Letran, he entered the University of 
			Santo Tomas, where he studied law and paleography. In 1886 he 
			finished the course on notary public, but could not practice it 
			because he was then 22 years old - three years short of the minimum 
			age required by law to qualify as notary public.
		</p>
		<p>
			To supplement the limited monthly allowance he received from his 
			mother, he became a journalist. Writing was in his blood, for he 
			inherited his passionate love for literature and writing ability 
			from his mother. He wrote articles for EI Diario de Manila, La 
			Oceania Espanol, EI Comercio, La Revista Popular, La Opinion, and 
			other Manila newspapers.
		</p>
		<p>
			On June 14, 1884, while he was a 2O-year old struggling 
			newspaperman, he married Josefa Sevilla of Malabon.
		</p>
		<p>
			In 1889 he founded the first vernacular newspaper in the 
			Philippines, Elllocano, with himself as editor as well as publisher. 
			This periodical did not last long. However, it achieved distinction 
			in the history of Philippine journalism. He made intensive 
			researches on Philippine history and culture and wrote various 
			historical works, such as Las Islas Visayas en la Epoca de la 
			Conquista(first edition in 187, second edition in 1889); La 
			Expedicion de Li-Mahong contra Filipinas en 1574 (1888); Triuntos 
			del Rosario 0 Los Holandeses en Filipinas (1888); Prehistoria de 
			Filipinas (1889); EI Folklore Filipino (1889); and Historia de 
			Ilocos (1890, 2 vols.).
		</p>
		<p>
			As a journalist, Don Belong, as he was fondly called, aroused the 
			hostility of the friars and officials because he openly criticized 
			the evils of the Spanish rule and advocate reforms. He particularly 
			denounced the huge haciendas of the religious orders and demanded 
			agrarian reform to ameliorate the miserable conditionof the landless 
			Fillipino tenants. The Spanish authorities naturally branded him as 
			a tilibusterismo (traitor).
		</p>
		<p>
			In January, 1897, shortly after the execution of the &quot;Thirteen 
			Martyrs of Bagumbayan,&quot; Don Belong was arrested and jailed in the 
			Bilibid Prison. He was one of the many patriots who were jailed and 
			tortured because of their complicity in the ranging revolution, 
			which Andres Bonifacio and his katipuneros began in the hills of 
			Balintawak in August, 1896. While he was agonizing in prison, his 
			sick wife died. The inhuman authorities, who called themselves 
			Christians, would not permit him even a few minutes to attend his 
			wife&#39;s funeral and see his orphaned children.
		</p>
		<p>
			Inside the bilibid Prison, Don Belong was able to talk with many 
			inmates, who were katipuneros, and learned from them the history of 
			the Katipunan and the reasons why they rose in arms against Spain. 
			Accordingly, he wrote within his prison cell the Sensacional Memoria 
			sobre la Revolucion Filipina, which became one of the valuable works 
			on the history of the revolution.
		</p>
		<p>
			The arrival of General Fernando Primo de Rivera in Manila on April 
			25, 197, as successor of the ruthless Governor-General Camilo de 
			Polavieja (who ordered the execution of many Filipino patriots, 
			including Dr. Rizal), saved Don Belong from the firing squad. This 
			new governor-general, comparatively more humane than Polavieja, 
			deported him to Spain, where he was incarcerated at the infamous 
			Montijuich Castle in Barcelona. When the Pact of Biak-na-Bato was 
			concluded on December 14-15, 1897, he was released. To silence his 
			trenchant pen and win over to Spanish side, he was given a 
			distinguished job as Consejero del Ministery de Ultramar (Counselor 
			of the Ministry of Colonies) in Madrid, a position which he held 
			from 1898 to 1901. At that time, the Spanish-American war was raging 
			in the Philippines and in the West Indies.
		</p>
		<p>
			While working in the Ministry of Colonies, Don Belong fell in love 
			with a charming Madrilena, Senorita Maria Angeles Lopez Montero, 
			daughter of a retired Spanish infantry colonel. He married her in 
			1898.
		</p>
		<p>
			His marriage to a Spanish girl and his having a good job in the 
			Spanish Government did not, however, diminish Don Belong&#39;s love for 
			his native land. His patriotism could not be bartered for a 
			beautiful girl and a high government position. In 1899 he published 
			in Madrid La Sensacional Memoria sobre la RevoluciolJ Filip in a , 
			which he had written in the Bilibid Prison. This book stirred great 
			sensation in Spain, for it exposed the evils of Spanish colonial 
			rule in the Philippines, such as the native Filipinos, thereby 
			causing the downfall of Spain in Asia. It had a preface written by 
			Don Miguel Morayta, Spanish historian, statesman, professor, and 
			friend of the Fillipino people.
		</p>
		<p>
			During the Fililpino-American War (1899-1902), he used his pen to 
			lambast the Yankee attack on the First Philippine Republic. He 
			founded and edited two nationalist periodicals in Madrid, EI 
			Defensor de Filipinas and Filipinas Ante Europa. He wrote two books, 
			both published in Madrid, namely, Independencia y Revolucion (1900) 
			which urged the Filipinos to carry on their war against American and 
			La Religion de Katipunan which discussed the teachings and 
			organization of the K.K.K.
		</p>
		<p>
			On July 1, 1901, the Spanish Government permitted Don Belong to 
			return to the Philippines. He brought many books with him, among 
			which were those written by Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, Victor 
			Hugo, Pierre Joseph Proudhon, Mikhail Bakunin, and other socialists 
			of Europe. These books inspired him to introduce socialism into his 
			own country. Shortly after his arrival in Manila, he contacted the 
			labor elements, urging them to unite and protect themselves from the 
			avaricious capitalists. He explained to them the benefits the)! 
			would derive by means of collective bargaining. On February 2, 1902. 
			he&quot;founded the first labor union in the Philippines, called the 
			Union Obrera Democratica Filipina (Philippine Democratic labor 
			Union), with himself as president and Hermenegildo Cruz as 
			secretary, Realizing the value of propaganda, he founded and edited 
			the first labor newspaper in the country, La Redencion del Obrero 
			(The Redemption of the laborer), which championed the rights of 
			labor.
		</p>
		<p>
			Utilizing his labor leadership, Don Belong, in a meeting of about 42 
			members of his labor organization at the Centro de Bellas Artes in 
			Quiapo on August 3, 1902, launched the Philippine Independent Church 
			and proclaimed Father Gregorio Aglipay as the Supreme bishop. 
			Shortly after this, he led a general strike of factory laborers and 
			farm tenants against the American business firms and friar-owned 
			haciendas. This general strike was sparked by a strike of the 
			Filipino cigar workers against the Commercial Tobacco factory in 
			Malabon, which was owned by Mr, Moxon, an American businessman. It 
			is said that more than 2,000 laborers and tenants demonstrated in 
			the streets of Manila. Civil Governor Taft had to call the U.S. 
			Calvary to disperse them.
		</p>
		<p>
			As the mastermind of the abortive general strike, Don Belong was 
			arrested and jailed in Malabon. He was convicted by the court on the 
			charge of public disturbance and sentenced to four months in prison. 
			Because of his imprisonment, the mantle of labor leadership passed 
			to the hands of the fiery Dr. Dominador Gomez on September 3, 1902.
		</p>
		<p>
			After his release from prison, Don Belong left Manila in February, 
			1903, for China and Japan. he was able to contact the self-exiled 
			revolutionary general, Artemio Ricarte, in Yokohama, on the 
			Philippine situation.
		</p>
		<p>
			He returned to Manila, and later, in 1905 he sailed for Spain, where 
			he worked as a juror Uurado) of the Spanish Government in barcelona 
			until 1908. On April 3, 1909, he returned to Manila, with his 
			Spanish wife and children. His wife died on February 10,1910.
		</p>
		<p>
			In 1912, at the age of 48, two great events highlighted Don Belong&#39;s 
			life - first was his marriage for the third time ans second, his 
			election as councilor of the city of Manila. His third wife was 
			Maria Um, a pretty 18-year old Chinese mestiza of Tondo. By winning 
			a seat in the city council, he began his political career. Impelled 
			by his nationalista sentiment and hatred for the friars, he passed 
			through the city council several resolutions changing the names of 
			ceratin streets bearing the names of the friars to those of the 
			Filipino patriots. Owning to his popularity among the asses, he was 
			re-elected for another term and served as city councilor until 1919.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the senatorial elections of 1922 he launched his candidacy in the 
			First Senatorial District (comprising the Ilocos provinces). His 
			opponent was ; Representative Elpidio Quirino, a rising Ilokano 
			politician. He won after a hard campaign. On May 27, 1923, while 
			serving his term in the Senate (1922-1928), his third wife died of 
			childbirth.
		</p>
		<p>
			Upon the expiration of his senatorial term, Don Belong gave up 
			politics and devoted the last years of his life to religion and 
			writing. As an honorary Bishop of the Aglipayan Church, he wrote 
			many sermons and other religious tracts. It should be noted that he 
			was the author of most of the Aglipayan literature, such as the 
			Biblia Filipina (Philippine Bible), Oficio Divino (Mass-Book), 
			Catequesis (Catechism), Plegarias (Prayers), Genesis Cientifico y 
			Moderno (Scientific and Modern Genesis), and Calendario Aglipayano 
			(Aglipayan Calendar). He also translated into Iloko the Gospels of 
			St. John, St. Luke, St. Mark, and St. Matthew; the New Testament; 
			and the Acts of the Apostles.
		</p>
		<p>
			In January, 1829, Don Belong was stricken with paralytic and became 
			bed-ridden until his death on October 10, 1938, at the age of 74. He 
			was survived by 15 of his 27 children by his three marriages.
