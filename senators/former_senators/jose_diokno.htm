		<p>
			Senator Jose W. Diokno born on February 26, 1922 to 
			Ramón Diokno and Leonor Wright. The senator obtained 
			his commerce degree from De La Salle College in 
			1939. He was in his second year in law at the 
			University of Sto. Tomas when the war interrupted 
			his studies. Disheartened, but not losing his 
			resolve to be a lawyer, he pursued his studies by 
			himself in his father’s law office.
		</p>
		<p>
			After becoming a member of the Philippine Bar, 
			Diokno engaged in law practice and reaped fame for 
			his successful handling of election and criminal 
			cases. So widespread and redoubtable was his 
			reputation that President Macapagal drafted him to 
			head the justice department.
		</p>
		<p>
			A one time legal adviser to the late Mayor Arsenio 
			Lacson, Diokno is also the legal counsel of the 
			Nacionalista Party. His professional affiliations 
			include: American Jurisdicature Society; Lawyers 
			Literary Club; member board of directors of the 
			Philippine Tuberculosis Society Inc.; De La Salle 
			Alumni Association and Philippine Institute of 
			certified Public Accountants.
		</p>
		<p>
			He served the Senate for two terms : 1963-1969 and 
			1968-1972.
		</p>
		<p>
			The senator was married to Carmen Icasiano. They 
			were blessed with nine children.
