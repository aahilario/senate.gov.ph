			Senator Mabanag was born on July 4, 1886 in San Fernando, La Union, 
			to Liberato Mabanag of Calamanugan, Cagayan and Manuela Razulo of 
			Bangar, La Union.
		</p>
		<p>
			For being studious, bright and industrious, Mabanag supported 
			himself while getting his higher education. He was clerk in the 
			defunct Executive Bureau from 1903 to 1912 and finished his Bachelor 
			of Arts at the University of Sto. Tomas in 1908. He was senior clerk 
			when he obtained his Bachelor of Laws degree from La Jurisprudencia 
			in 1912 and passed the bar examinations the same year.
		</p>
		<p>
			He opened his law firm in Lingayen, Pangasinan and attracted big 
			clients in the province. His popularity and his ability became his 
			qualifications for a three year service as Lingayen municipal 
			councilor from 1916 to 1919. He ran for senator and won 
			overwhelmingly to represent the second senatorial district of la 
			Union in 1922 and re-elected in 1931.
		</p>
		<p>
			Upon the establishment of the Commonwealth government on November 
			15, 1935, President Manuel L. Quezon appointed him Judge of the 
			Court of First Instance of Iloilo up to 1938 and later named as city 
			fiscal of Manila until 1945.
		</p>
		<p>
			He ran anew for the Senatorial election and won in 1946 but he lost 
			in the 1949 election. As a distinguished Senator he became the 
			chairman of the Senate Blue Ribbon Committee from August 1952 to 
			August 1953 and in 1953 elections he ran and won again as Senator 
			under the Magsaysay ticket. He was also member of the following 
			committees; Corporations and Franchises, Codes and Constitutional 
			amendments, Government Reorganization, Investigation, Justice, Labor 
			and Immigration, National Defense and Security, National 
			Enterprises, provincial and Municipal Governments and Cities,
