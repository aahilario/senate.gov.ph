		<p class="h1_bold">Camilo Olaviano Osias</p>
		<p>
			This educator-writer from the North was one of the rare and grand 
			old men of the Philippines who displayed vigorously intellect, a 
			tremendous drive and a passion for independence.
		</p>
		<p>
			Osias was born in Balaoan, La Union on March 28, 1889. His parents 
			were Manuel Osias and Gregoria Olaviano. He studied in Balaoan, La 
			Union; Vigan, Ilocos Sur and San Fernando, La Union before he was 
			chosen as one of the government scholars to be sent to the United 
			States. He received his teacher’s diploma from the Illinois State 
			Teacher’s College in 1905. He went on to study for a Bachelor of 
			Arts degree at Columbia University where he also received his 
			graduate diploma in administration and supervision.
		</p>
		<p>
			His public service, particularly in the field of education, has 
			earned for him recognition from Otterbein College in Ohio, United 
			States, which awarded him an honorary degree of Doctor of Laws in 
			1934, and from the National University which gave him an honorary 
			degree of Doctor of Pedagogy in 1961.
		</p>
		<p>
			Osias rose from being a classroom teacher to being the first 
			Filipino division superintendent of schools. He also became the 
			first president of the National University.
		</p>
		<p>
			A prolific writer, Osias authored such well-known books as 
			Philippine Readers, The Filipino Way of Life, the prize winning Jose 
			Rizal : His life and Times and countless other books and articles, a 
			majority of which were on his favorite subject – Rizal. He also 
			translated many of the hero’s major and minor works into English and 
			Ilocano.
		</p>
		<p>
			He was a member of the first Independence Mission to the United 
			States in 1921. In 1929, he went to the United States as resident 
			commissioner to the US Congress until 1935, working zealously for 
			the Independence Bill.
		</p>
		<p>
			As a delegate to the Philippine Constitutional Convention of 1934 
			for the first district of La Union, he actively participated in 
			committee work and debates on the floor. As legislator and 
			Constitutional Convention delegate, Osias was an outstanding 
			champion of academic freedom and civil liberties which he considered 
			as the true foundation of democratic policy.
		</p>
		<p>
			He was elected senator for the second senatorial district in 1925. 
			Since then, he had been elected several times to the Legislature --- 
			assemblyman in 1935; senator-at-large in 1947 during which he topped 
			the list of winning senatorial candidates; and again as senator in 
			1961.
		</p>
		<p>
			Osias always advocated a fair, just and equitable allocation of 
			membership in committees he chaired. His contributions to the 
			government still carry his personality --- the pipe-smoking, 
			gleaming-eyed and impeccably eloquent image of the Filipino as a 
			statesman.
		</p>
		<p>
			He died on May 20, 1976.
