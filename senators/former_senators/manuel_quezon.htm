		<p class="h1_bold">Manuel L. Quezon</p>
		<p>
			Manuel Luis Quezon was born on August 19, 1878 in Baler, Tayabas 
			(now Quezon), to Lucio Quezon, a native of Paco, Manila and Maria 
			Dolores Molina.
		</p>
		<p>
			He studied law at the University of Sto. Tomas and passed the bar 
			examinations in 1903. He became the fiscal of his home province and 
			was soon elected governor.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the 1907 election, he ran for the Philippine Assembly under the 
			Nacionalista Party, won by a large majority, and became the majority 
			floor leader.
		</p>
		<p>
			In 1909, he was elected Resident Commissioner to Washington, D.C., a 
			post he held until 1916. His most significant achievement was the 
			passage of the Jones Act that provided for the grant of Philippine 
			independence.
		</p>
		<p>
			He was elected senator in 1916 and eventually became Senate 
			President. He headed the first Independence Mission to the U.S. 
			Congress, and brought home the Tydings-McDuffie Independence Law in 
			1934.
		</p>
		<p>
			The “ Star of Baler “ shone as the First President of the 
			Commonwealth after his brilliant performance as the First Senate 
			President. He was steadfast in his vision to deliver the masses from 
			the shackles of colonialism which intensified his efforts to secure 
			independence for his country. Such vision culminated in the 
			establishment of political stability within the framework of the 
			1935 Constitution, the formulation of policies to ensure the social 
			well-being of the people, and the adjustment of the national economy 
			to the challenges of independent nationhood. He was a dynamic 
			Filipino leader and a true friend of the poor and the oppressed whom 
			he loved and cared so well. Quezon is one of the most illustrious 
			sons our country has ever produced.
		</p>
		<p>
			Quezon was married to Aurora Aragon and had four children : Maria 
			Aurora, Luisa Corazon Paz and Manuel Jr. He died on August 1, 1944 
			in Saranac Lake, New York.
