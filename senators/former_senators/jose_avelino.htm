		<p>
			Jose D. Avelino was born in Calbayog, Samar on August 5, 1890. His 
			parents were Alfonsa Dera and Baltazar Avelino.
		</p>
		<p>
			Avelino pursued a Bachelor of Arts degree at the Ateneo de Manila 
			and then went to the University of the Philippines where he 
			graduated with a degree in Bachelor of Laws. In 1934, he was 
			admitted to the Philippine bar and was conferred with a degree of 
			Master of Laws by the University of Santo Tomas.
		</p>
		<p>
			Avelino was a municipal councilor in his hometown of Calbayog from 
			1917 to 1919. After two years, he was elected representative of the 
			first district of Samar in the house of Representatives. He served 
			in that capacity until 1928.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the same year, Avelino won a seat in the Senate where he 
			represented the ninth senatorial district from 1928 to 1934. He won 
			a second term and during the tenth Philippine Legislature, he served 
			as Majority Floor Leader. With his sharp argumentative prowess, he 
			won the respect of his colleagues for which they elected him 
			President Pro-Tempore and later as Senate President. Through the 
			turbulent post-war years when the administration was subjected to 
			upheaval, Avelino strove to lead the Senate through the straits of 
			reconstruction with vigilance and a strong political will.
		</p>
		<p>
			Avelino retired from public life and devoted himself to the practice 
			of law until his death.
