		<p>
			Senator Rogelio de la Rosa was born Regidor de la Rosa on November 
			12, 1916 in Lubao, Pampanga. His parents were Feliciano de la Rosa, 
			the arnis de mano champion of Pampanga during his time, and Rosario 
			Lim, a patron of the theater and the arts.
		</p>
		<p>
			Senator De la Rosa was sports-minded and highly competitive, 
			qualities he inherited from his father. He was captain of an 
			undefeated basketball team in Central Luzon. In 1932, he became the 
			inter-collegiate welter-weight boxing champion. This was when he was 
			already a student in Far Eastern University, where he also excelled 
			in team debates and oratorical contests on inter-provincial and 
			inter-collegiate levels. Among the many awards he won in such 
			contests from 1932 to 1934 was the 1933 Claro M. Recto gold medal.
		</p>
		<p>
			He obtained his associate in arts degree from FEU which, years 
			later, named him its outstanding alumnus.
		</p>
		<p>
			He started his movie career as a singer who accompanied himself on 
			the ukulele, performed as a regular villain in Pampango zarzuelas 
			during his teens.
		</p>
		<p>
			It was his uncle, Gregorio Fernandez, who directed him in his first 
			starring role in a motion picture in 1929, “Ligaw na Bulaklak,” 
			opposite Rosa del Rosario. He became very popular because of his 
			dashing good looks and, since then, was always cast as a gallant 
			lover in countless movies and paired with pretty actresses. The 
			roles given to him during the prewar days were neither significant 
			nor substantial.
		</p>
		<p>
			When the war broke out his life changed. He appeared in stage shows 
			at the Life Theatre during the Japanese occupation. The experience 
			made him not only a stronger person but a finer actor as well. When 
			he resurfaced on the screen after the war, he no longer looked or 
			behaved like yesterday’s swain-he had become more sophisticated, he 
			put more character into his roles. It was at his stage of his career 
			that he became the first Filipino to star in an American Picture, 
			“The Avenger,” which was produced in Hollywood. In 1956, he won the 
			best actor award of the Filipino Academy of Movie Arts and Sciences 
			(FAMAS) for his role in “Higit sa Lahat,” with Emma Alegre, and 
			adjudged Southeast Asia’a best actor in the Hongkong Film Festival.
		</p>
		<p>
			Shortly afterwards, he entered politics. He ran in the senatorial 
			race in 1957 and won. During the 1961 presidential polls, he decided 
			to run as an independent against two other presidential contenders: 
			the incumbent President, Carlos P. Garcia, of the Nacionalista 
			Party, and Liberal Party bet Diosdado Macapagal.
		</p>
		<p>
			At the height of his campaign, however, he decided to withdraw from 
			the race. Although he knew that he was drawing the biggest 
			audiences, it occurred to him that translating those audiences into 
			actual votes was a different matter. Politics during those days was 
			really dirty. While most of his campaign leaders were sincere and 
			dedicated, there were many who kept asking him for money. An honest 
			analysis of the situation made him realize that while he could beat 
			Macapagal-who, like him, came from Central Luzon – Garcia would 
			ultimately win since the votes from Luzon would be split between 
			them, while those from Visayas and Mindanao would go for Garcia, who 
			hailed from the south. There was a need for a change in 
			administration and the only way this could be accomplished was for 
			him to withdraw in favor of Macapagal. His analysis proved correct, 
			for Macapagal became president.
		</p>
		<p>
			In 1965, De la Rosa was appointed Philippine Ambassador to Cambodia, 
			now Kampuchea, and designated as the dean of the diplomatic corps. 
			He was respected and admired by Prince Norodom Sihanouk, Cambodia’s 
			head of state. His next assignment was ambassador to the Netherlands 
			and concurrently, as ambassador to Poland, Bulgaria and 
			Czekoslovakia. During this period, socialist countries came to 
			recognize the Philippines. He was again designated the dean of the 
			diplomatic corps during his tenure in the Netherlands.
		</p>
		<p>
			As a diplomat, he did a lot for the art and culture of the 
			Philippines by encouraging and helping local artists to put up art 
			exhibits abroad and to participate in international conferences and 
			competitions in arts.
		</p>
		<p>
			De la Rosa again tried to go into politics by running in the 1984 
			Batasang Pambansa elections, but lost.
		</p>
		<p>
			He died of a heart attack on November 10, 1986, at the age of 70. He 
			was married to Lota Delgado one of his leading ladies in the movies.
