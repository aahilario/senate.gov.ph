			Born in Manila on January 1, 1961, Senator Manuel P. Manahan 
			finished his High School and College at the Ateneo de Manila. He was 
			the publisher of Liberty News Bagong Buhay, and Voz de Manila, and 
			during the United Nations Conference in San Francisco, he 
			represented the Philippine press. His journalistic career actually 
			began after his release from Fort Santiago during the world war II. 
			He worked for the underground press for which he was awarded the 
			Legion of Honor.

			When President Magsaysay began reorganizing his cabinet, he had no 
			difficulty finding the right man to head the Presidential office.

			Manahan effected reforms and improvements in the bureau of customs, 
			bureau of internal revenue, national bureau of investigation, motors 
			vehicles office and other key government agencies.

			He also played a significant role in the negotiations for the 
			surrender of Huk Supremo Luis Taruc.
		</p>
		<p>
			As commissioner of customs, Manahan was able to institute important 
			reforms in one of the most graft - prone agencies of the government. 
			For his remarkable record of public service, the Philippines Free 
			Press cited him as “Man of the Year” in 1955.

			Together with Senator Manglapus, he worked for the decentralization 
			bill. He became chairman of the Senate Committees on Banks,
