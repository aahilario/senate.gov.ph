			practiced his law profession and at the same time taught at the 
			Escuela de Derecho when he left newspaper work in 1903.

			represented the fourth district comprising Laguna, Manila, Rizal and 
			Biñan. In 1917, he was appointed by Governor-General Francis B. 
			Harrison to the Cabinet as Secretary of Interior and became the 
			first official to hold concurrently legislature and executive 
			positions and his term in the Senate ended in June 1922. In July 
			1925, he was inaugurated as the fourth president of the University
