		<p class="h1_bold">Joaquin Luna</p>
		<p>
			Senator Luna was born in Manila on December 11, 1874. He was a 
			brother of the famous Lunas from the north, Juan the artist and 
			Antonio the general. Like his brother Antonio, he also took part in 
			the Philippine Revolution and became a colonel in the revolutionary 
			army.
		</p>
		<p>
			At the Malolos Congress, he represented the province of La Union and 
			served as treasurer of Asociacion de Paz, which hoped to enforce 
			peace through the surrender of arms by the Filipino rebels in 
			exchange for amnesty during the American occupation.
		</p>
		<p>
			In 1901, Senator Luna became one of the principal members of the 
			organizing committee of the Democratic Party and in 1903 he was 
			appointed as an agent in the International Exposition in St. Louis, 
			Missouri.
		</p>
		<p>
			Senator Luna was elected governor in 1904 of La Union, which 
			declared him an adopted son in 1905, in a resolution passed by the 
			assembly of municipal presidents of the province. He was twice 
			elected as representative to the Philippine Assembly representing La 
			Union’s first district from 1907 to 1912 and from 1912 to 1916. In 
			1916, he was appointed governor of Mt. Province and later was 
			appointed Senator from the 12th Senatorial district comprising the 
			city of Baguio, Mountain Province, and Nueva Viscaya as well as 
			Mindanao and Sulu from 1916 to 1919.
		</p>
		<p>
			As a lawmaker, Luna who had musical inclinations, was instrumental 
			in pushing for the bill creating a musical school, later to be known 
			as the Conservatory of Music under the University of the 
			Philippines, which was established in 1908.
		</p>
		<p>
			In honor of Joaquin Luna and his more illustrious brothers, the 
			municipality of Namakpakan in La Union, where their mother was born, 
			was renamed “Luna” in 1907.
