		<p>
			Senator Tomas Confesor was born in Iloilo on March 2, 1891. His 
			parents were Julian Confesor and Prospera Valenzuela.
		</p>
		<p>
			Poverty was not a hindrance to Confesor’s quest for academic 
			excellence. He studied at the Iloilo High school and in 1908 
			finished with distinction. He left Iloilo for United States and 
			worked as janitor to support himself in college. He acquired two 
			degrees- Bachelor of Science in Commerce, from the University of 
			California and Bachelor of Philosophy in Economics, from the 
			University of Chicago.
		</p>
		<p>
			The American authorities appointed him school supervisor of Jaro, 
			Iloilo upon his return to the Philippines. In 1922, he won a seat in 
			the Philippine legislature as representative of the Third District 
			of Iloilo. He earned distinction as the &quot;stormy petrel of the House&quot; 
			because of his determined stands against anomalous acts of 
			administration. Thereafter, in recognition of his crusade for clean 
			government , the people of Iloilo elected him for two more terms. As 
			legislator, he was the sponsor of Act 3425, otherwise known as the 
			Cooperatives Marketing law, which promoted the cooperative movement 
			on the Philippines, particularly the establishment of farmer’s 
			cooperatives.
		</p>
		<p>
			In 1933, Confesor was appointed as the first Filipino Director of 
			Commerce by Gov. Gen. Theodore Roosevelt, Jr. Later, during the 
			Commonwealth government, he was named by President Manuel L. Quezon 
			as head of the National Cooperatives Administration. Confesor 
			initiated the organization of financing groups, which freed 
			countless small farmers from the grip of rapacious businessmen and 
			usurers.
		</p>
		<p>
			Confesor was one of the delegates to the Constitutional Convention 
			that drafted the 1935 Constitution of the Philippines.
		</p>
		<p>
			He was on his second term as a governor of Iloilo when the Pacific 
			War broke. During the Japanese occupation, he was invited to serve 
			the puppet Cabinet, but he declined. This angered the Japanese, who 
			harassed him thereafter.
		</p>
		<p>
			Conscious of his patriotic duty, Confesor left Manila and secretly 
			returned to his home province, where he organized his own 
			underground movement. Upon learning of his activities in Iloilo, 
			President Quezon immediately named him &quot;wartime governor of Free 
			Panay and Romblon.&quot; Throughout the occupation, Confesor chose to 
			lead his guerrillas in fighting the Japanese, for he believed that 
			it was better &quot;to suffer in honor than to enjoy life in ignominy.&quot;
		</p>
		<p>
			President Sergio Osmeña awarded him the Philippine Legion of honor, 
			degree of commander, in 1945, for his exemplary service during the 
			war. Following the restoration of the Commonwealth government, he 
			was inducted into office as Secretary of the Interior on April 8, 
			1945.
		</p>
		<p>
			Confesor was elected senator during the national elections of 1946. 
			However, he suffered a fatal heart attack on June 6, 1951, leaving 
			his six-year tenure unfinished. He was married to Rosalina Grecia of 
			Jaro, Iloilo, with whom he had a son.
