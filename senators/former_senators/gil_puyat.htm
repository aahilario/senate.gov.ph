			pursued at the University of the Philippines where he topped his

			family business caught the eye of the late President Manuel L. 
			Quezon. At the time, the country was predominantly agricultural in 
			activity and the President was advocating industrialization. Quezon 
			named the young Puyat as dean of the College of Business

			Philippine Institute of Public Opinion (PIPO) awarded him a 
			certificate of honor for demonstrating national leadership in 
			business, economics, the civic and political fields and for his 
			distinguished service to the youth. Puyat consistently served 
			various other organizations which saw in him a champion of civics 
			and charity.
