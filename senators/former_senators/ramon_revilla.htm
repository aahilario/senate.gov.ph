		<p class="h1_bold">Ramon B. Revilla</p>
		<p>
			Born Jose Acuna Bautista in Imus, Cavite Senator Ramon Revilla 
			experienced an otherwise ordinary childhood until after his 
			completion of a Bachelor&#39;s Degree in Commerce at the Far Eastern 
			University.
		</p>
		<p>
			He then devoted seven years of unblemished government service at the 
			Customs Bureau as Sr. Intelligence Officer with the rank of Major 
			from 1965-1972 as head of the Secret Service Unit. The precursor of 
			the present Customs Intelligence and Investigation Division, until 
			the lure of the silver screen became too enticing to ignore.
		</p>
		<p>
			His entry into the glitzy world of showbusiness proved rewarding 
			financially, plus the various citations awarded him for his 
			brilliant portrayals on and off camera as actor, producer, 
			scriptwriter and socio-civic leader made him a big-name in 
			entertainment and social circles.
		</p>
		<p>
			Some of these awards are the FAMAS Best Actor in 1973 for the movie 
			&#39;Hulihin Si Tiyagong Akyat&#39;; Box Office King in 1979 and the Most 
			Outstanding Actor of the Year that same year; Outstanding Producer 
			of the Year in 1976; Outstanding Film Production and Socio-civic 
			Leader in 1975.
		</p>
		<p>
			Clinching the second slot in the 1992 senatorial elections came as a 
			surprise to some but as an eye-opener to the then novice legislator. 
			Three years after, he has become known as the Father of the Public 
			Works Act, a result of his being designated chair of the Senate 
			Public Works Committee and his authorship of Republic Act 8150 which 
			was signed into law by President Fidel V. Ramos on September 8, 
			1995.
		</p>
		<p>
			This program is expected to trigger huge spendings that would pump 
			prime the Philippine economy. It identifies the infrastructure 
			projects to be pursued all over the country, including remote and 
			less developed barangays. According to the World Bank the country 
			needs between $40 to $50 billion in infrastructure investments to 
			sustain economic development, attract foreign investments and enable 
			the Philippines to catch up with its more economically aggressive 
			neighbors.
		</p>
		<p>
			The infrastructure projects are deemed important to support the 
			movement of goods and services in and out of the country. Such 
			movement is a necessary prerequisite for the nation to become a 
			newly industrialized economy as envisioned by the Ramos and Estrada 
			administrations, an objective similarly adopted by the present 
			Gloria M. Arroyo government.
		</p>
		<p>
			The program also known as the Public Works and Highways 
			Infrastructure Program Act of 1995, specifies the State&#39;s policy on 
			infrastructure development. A state policy is important to put 
			priorities in order and to stop graft. A sharp contrast to previous 
			plans where government policies were not clearly spelled out, 
			exposing infrastructure development to political meddling.
		</p>
		<p>
			Due to the shock waves of the Asian financial crisis which radiated 
			throughout the region in 1996. Revilla&#39;s infrastructure program was 
			not fully funded leaving it only 65% complete until the law lapsed 
			in 1999. Envisioning uniform progress from Luzon&#39;s tip to Mindanao&#39;s 
			edge, Senator Revilla, on his second and final term as member of the 
			upper chamber, is finalizing a more ambitious medium to long term 
			infrastructure program, touted to be the cornerstone of the 
			country&#39;s rise from the effects of the five year economic slump.
		</p>
		<p>
			Realizing the urgency and impact of this piece of legislation, 
			President Arroyo stamped it &#39;URGENT&#39; before Congress took its three 
			month break for this year&#39;s May elections, ensuring its passage into 
			law before the 11th Congress took its final bow on June 2001. 
			&quot;Progress is meaningless if it is not seen and felt nationwide, from 
			the cities to the remotest barrios and its effects felt and 
			appreciated by the masses,&quot; he said.
		</p>
		<p>
			However, political kinks in the lower House prevented the passage of 
			this vital piece of legislation even as the Senate during one of 
			Congress&#39; special sessions, approved the bill on third and final 
			reading. Senator Revilla hopes to steer the new version of the bill 
			into law before bowing out of public service in 2004, this he said 
			will be his legacy to the Filipino people.
		</p>
		<p>
			Alarmed by the steady rise of drug-related crimes, the growth of the 
			illegal drugs trade and the looming threat of narco-politics, 
			Senator Revilla introduced an amendment to the present Dangerous 
			Drugs Act (R.A. 6425) by increasing the penalties presently 
			stipulated and plugging the loophole often used by violators to 
			escape harsh penalties thereby making a mockery of the judicial 
			system. His amendment imposes the penalty of life imprisonment to 
			death on drug traffickers, dealers and users regardless of the 
			quantity and purity of illegal drugs confiscated from them.
		</p>
		<p>
			The present Drugs law which many describe as antiquated, is silent 
			on the issue of Purity, providing a convenient technicality for 
			offenders to take advantage of, claiming they should be given 
			lighter sentences or granted bail since the drugs confiscated are 
			either adulterated or impure.
		</p>
		<p>
			Some sectors may see this amendment as too harsh but according to 
			the Cavite Solon, without tougher drug laws the drug menace will 
			remain as an insurmountable obstacle to our nation&#39;s economic 
			progress and political stability aside from permanently scarring our 
			youth. &quot;Drastic steps must be taken to slice into the root of this 
			progressing threat. Congress must step in and redesign R.A. 6425 and 
			make it a more effective weapon against the illegal drugs trade 
			before it grows too big to eventually control, and earn for our 
			country the notoriety of being Asia&#39;s drug paradise,&quot; he said.
		</p>
		<p>
			Simultaneously, Senator Ramon Revilla worked for the advancement of 
			the Philippine Motion Picture Industry and our children&#39;s welfare in 
			his capacity as chairman of the Senate Committee on Motion Pictures 
			and Television in the 10th and 11th Congresses.
		</p>
		<p>
			Notable of these are the public hearings conducted with members of 
			both the public and private sectors involved in the television 
			industry which aims to make current television programs 
			children-friendly. Limiting if not totally eliminating the violent 
			and sex scenes on television specially during hours when children 
			are likely to view them. As a result of these consultations, the 
			Children&#39;s Media Act or R.A. 8370 was signed into law by President 
			Ramos on Oct. 28, 1997. Revilla, co-sponsor of the vital measure, 
			saw to it that all television networks devote at least 15% or three 
			hours of their total daily airtime programming to educational shows 
			for children.
		</p>
		<p>
			This law recognizes the vital role of the youth in nation-building 
			and the influence of broadcast media, specifically television, in 
			molding a child&#39;s intellectual, emotional and social well-being. 
			President Ramos&#39;s action assures the nation&#39;s children of 
			top-quality educational shows while minimizing and hopefully 
			eliminating sex and violence on television during hours when 
			children are most likely to see them. Once instituted, this will aid 
			in the development of our children&#39;s awareness and appreciation for 
			our cultural identity, national heritage and social issues that will 
			help them grow to be productive and nationalistic citizens, Sen. 
			Revilla said.
		</p>
		<p>
			One of the heavily taxed industries in the country today is the 
			movie industry. Aiming to correct this flaw in the system while 
			envisioning the enrichment of our culture through the production of 
			more first rate motion pictures, Senator Revilla filed S.B. 1959 
			creating the Film Development Board which will be given the power to 
			grant tax rewards in the form of rebates, to movie producers whose 
			films are rated top notch by the Board&#39;s committee. Revilla sees 
			this as the impetus needed to revive the slowly dying Philippine 
			movie industry and give the Filipino audience motion pictures with 
			enduring social, cultural and moral values.
		</p>
		<p>
			June 6, 1997 is a date etched in the milestones of Philippine 
			legislation when President Ramos affixed his signature on Senate 
			bill 1148, principally authored by Revilla, amending and 
			subsequently lowering the penalties imposed on the illegal 
			possession of firearms. Now known as &#39;The Revilla Law&#39; R.A. 8294 has 
			diminished the terror of Presidential Decree 1866, a remnant of the 
			deposed Marcos regime.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Senator crafted the law to benefit those imprisoned and 
			persecuted during the Marcos years for their political beliefs and 
			whose incarceration was brought about by the abusive implementation 
			of PD 1866.
		</p>
		<p>
			Soon to be completed by the Public Works Committee under Senator 
			Revilla&#39;s guidance is a Code designed to preserve the interests of 
			government against anomalous and irregular contracts. These 
			contracts include infrastructure agreements and those involving the 
			procurement and sale of government properties. This Code is foreseen 
			to minimize if not eradicate graft and corruption involving 
			government projects.
		</p>
		<p>
			Possessing an unwavering conviction that life is precious at the 
			moment of conception, and that every child has the right to 
			experience the fullness of life, Senator Revilla is pressing for 
			heavier anti-abortion legislation by raising the penalties presently 
			prescribed for fetal murders.
		</p>
		<p>
			In deference to the nation&#39;s teaching force, he too is pushing for 
			the Public School Teachers Retirement Upgrading Bill providing for 
			automatic promotion and salary/retirement benefits for retiring 
			public tutors and scholarships for their dependents. Giving this 
			benefit to the men and women who offered themselves wholeheartedly 
			to a profession which may never give them fame nor fortune, seems 
			little for a nation which will forever be grateful for their 
			selfless sacrifice, the solon said in explaining the urgency of this 
			particular measure.
		</p>
		<p>
			As former chairman of the Senate Public Information and Mass Media 
			Committee, the &#39;gentleman from Cavite&#39; formulated the &#39;Media 
			Security Bill&#39; which imposes additional penalties on individuals who 
			willingly curtail or stiffle press freedom. A salient provision of 
			this bill is the imposition of additional penalties, aside from 
			those already prescribed in the Revised Penal Code, to those who 
			threaten, coerce, inflict harm or injury or kill any bona fide 
			member of media in the performance of his duty.
		</p>
		<p>
			In recognition of the athletes who through sheer guts and hardwork 
			have given the country fame and glory, Sen. Revilla&#39;s proposal (SB 
			877) was signed into law during the last days of the 11th Congress 
			by President Arroyo, giving sportsmen who have distinguished 
			themselves in international sporting events and have won 
			championships, a lifetime monthly pension. A small token, he says, 
			from countrymen who will forever be proud of their accomplishments.
		</p>
		<p>
			He also steered the creation of additional engineering districts in 
			remote areas in fulfillment of his objective to make infrastructure 
			work for the benefit of every Filipino regardless of ideology or 
			political persuasion.
		</p>
		<p>
			The remaining years of his term as Senator would be devoted on 
			overseeing the developments and results of the Public Works Act 
			which he deems as his legacy to the Filipino people for their belief 
			and unwavering support, and by the end of his term, expects to hand 
			them additional legislation which would benefit the majority and not 
			the privileged few.
		</p>
		<p>
			For the 12th Congress, the gentleman from Cavite has filed bills and 
			resolutions directly responding to the problems gnawing at our 
			nation&#39;s march towards progress, inspired by his desire to live up 
			to his creed that, &quot;it is not enough that the Filipino people are 
			served, but they must be served well.&quot;
		</p>
		<p>
			His work as a member of the Senate was recognized by his alma mater 
			the Far Eastern University, when he was unanimously chosen as 
			outstanding alumnus in the field of public service, specifically 
			legislation in 1997.
