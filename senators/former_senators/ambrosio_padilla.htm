		<p>
			AMBROSIO BIBBY PADILLA was born in Lingayen, Pangasinan on December 
			7, 1910, the eighth of 11 children to Dr. Nicanor Padilla and Ysabel 
			Bibby. On May 4, 1941, he married the beautiful Lourdes “Lily” de 
			las Alas, the eldest daughter of Don Antonio de las Alas who served 
			as Secretary of Finance under President Manuel L. Quezon. They were 
			blessed with 10 children: 6 boys and 4 girls.
		</p>
		<p>
			Paddy (as he would be fondly remembered) was an exemplary and gifted 
			student, possessing an outstanding scholastic record. He graduated 
			summa cum laude from the Ateneo de Manila University with a degree 
			of Bachelor of Arts; finished his Bachelor of Laws as salutatorian 
			at the University of the Philippines; and placed third overall in 
			the 1934 bar examinations. He earned his Doctorate Degree in Civil 
			Laws (D.C.L.) meritissimus at the University of Sto. Tomas.
		</p>
		<p>
			An accomplished and well-rounded athlete and sportsman, in 
			particular as a basketball player, Paddy was captain and playing 
			coach of the national basketball team that placed fifth in the 1936 
			Berlin World Olympic Games, the best finish ever achieved by the 
			country, losing only once to the United States. He immeasurably 
			promoted and contributed to the development of sports by serving 
			with distinction a number of positions, among them as President of 
			the Philippine Amateur Athletic Federation (PAAF), President 
			Emeritus of the Asean Basketball Confederation (ABC), and Chairman 
			of the National Olympic Committee (NOC).
		</p>
		<p>
			Paddy had a brilliant career as law practitioner, professor, 
			reviewer and prolific author of books in political and 
			constitutional law, public international law and civil and criminal 
			law, earning for himself not only the respect and admiration of the 
			people who are knowledgeable on law and his clients, but also even 
			his adversaries. He was a professor and educator with a passion to 
			serve truth and justice.
		</p>
		<p>
			He had a distinguished, untainted and exemplary career in public 
			service. Guided by his tenet of “Morality in public life, Morality 
			in private life”, he ably and with integrity served the government 
			in various positions. His first stint in government was when he was 
			personally chosen by President Ramon Magsaysay to serve 
			simultaneously as Solicitor General and Government Corporate 
			Counsel, from 1954-1957. Later, he became an outstanding senator of 
			the Republic for three consecutive terms – 1957, 1963 and 1969, the 
			last term interrupted by the advent of martial law.
		</p>
		<p>
			Notwithstanding his stature and brushing aside the dangers arising 
			from his opposition to the martial law regime, he vigorously fought 
			the dictatorship with his legal prowess and belief in freedom.
		</p>
		<p>
			With the consequent return to democratic rule in the country, and in 
			recognition of his unrelenting contribution to public service, he 
			was appointed in 1986 by President Corazon C. Aquino as member and 
			eventually elected as vice chairman of the historic Constitutional 
			Commission which drafted the 1987 Constitution which was 
			overwhelming ratified by the people.
		</p>
		<p>
			Together with his ever-loving wife Lily, they nurtured a closely 
			knit family founded on love, unity, respect and devotion to each 
			other.
		</p>
		<p>
			Senator Ambrosio B. Padilla led and served a life of devotion to God 
			and country, exuding the best in the Filipino. Truly, his life was 
			worth emulating.
