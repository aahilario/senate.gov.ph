		<p>
			Son of Senator Alauya Alonto, Senator Alonto was born in Ramain, 
			Lanao, on August 1, 1914.
		</p>
		<p>
			As a member of Congress, Senator Alonto believed that the economic 
			destiny of the Philippines lies in the development of Mindanao, and 
			he was most insistent and energetic in making his colleagues and the 
			country at large Mindanao conscious.
		</p>
		<p>
			To achieve his objectives, he filed bills all designed to develop 
			Mindanao and its people economically, politically and culturally. He 
			authored a bill creating the Mindanao Development Authority; the law 
			establishing the University of Mindanao; the law providing for more 
			autonomous local governments in relatively backward rural areas; and 
			the law creating the Commission on National Integration. He was most 
			insistent and vocal for the promotion of understanding between 
			Filipino Muslims and their Christian brothers, for only with unity 
			forged can real progress be achieved.
		</p>
		<p>
			But his horizons were not limited within the confines of Mindanao. 
			He, too was nationally conscious. Thus, both in the halls of 
			Congress and in public engagements, he was a strong advocate for the 
			passage of nationalization laws. He was a co-author of the retail 
			trade nationalization law and an uncompromising opponent against its 
			repeal until incontrovertible proof was shown that same was adverse 
			to our national interests.
		</p>
		<p>
			He was chairman of the Special Committee created by the House of 
			Representatives to find a definite solution to the so-called Moro 
			Problem.
		</p>
		<p>
			Senator Alonto was elected in 1955 and served the Senate up to 1961. 
			He also gained international recognition due to his being a member 
			of the Philippine delegation to the African-Asian Conference in 
			Bandung. While at Bandung he broadened his contacts with prominent 
			leaders of the Middle East.
