		<p class="h1_bold">Claro M. Recto</p>
		<p>
			Claro M. Recto, dubbed the “Great Academician” by writers of 
			national prominence, was born on February 8, 1890 in Tiaong, Tayabas 
			(Now Quezon) province to Don Claro Recto, Sr. of Rosario Batangas 
			and Doña Micaela Mayo of Lipa.
		</p>
		<p>
			His elementary education was obtained in Tiaong, and part of his 
			high school studies in Lipa, Batangas. He enrolled later in Ateneo 
			where he received his A.B. degree, maxima cum laude, 1909. He then 
			learned his LL.M. degree at the University of Sto. Tomas in 1914 and 
			was admitted to the Philippine Bar the same year.
		</p>
		<p>
			Recto was first elected as member of the House of Representatives 
			for the Third District of Batangas in 1919, serving as Minority 
			Floor Leader with distinction for several years with his good grasp 
			of parliamentary proceedings that won for him the acclaim of both 
			his friends and political adversaries.
		</p>
		<p>
			In 1931, Recto was elected senator for a six-year term representing 
			the Fifth Senatorial District, comprising the provinces of Batangas, 
			Tayabas, Cavite, Mindoro and Marinduque, where he served as Minority 
			Floor Leader (1931-1934) and Majority Floor Leader and President 
			Pro-Tempore (1934). It was in the Senate where Recto answered to the 
			name of a “one-man fiscalizer”.
		</p>
		<p>
			In 1935, he was appointed by President Roosevelt as Associate 
			Justice of the Philippine Supreme Court, and as a jurist, he stood 
			at par with any international lawyer of fame. He was a worthy 
			protagonist in many remarkable and famous debates, even holding his 
			own against the Attorney General of the United States on the 
			question of ownership of military bases in the Philippines.
		</p>
		<p>
			When the assembly to draft the Philippine Constitution was convened 
			(1934-1935), Recto was selected president and personally presented 
			the Commonwealth Constitution to President Roosevelt for his 
			approval and signature.
		</p>
		<p>
			Recto was again elected senator in 1941, 1949 and 1955.
		</p>
		<p>
			He also served the country as Associate Justice of the Supreme Court 
			(1935-1936), Commissioner of Education, Health and Public Welfare 
			(1942-1943), Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (1943-1944) and 
			Cultural Envoy with the rank of Ambassador Extraordinary and 
			Minister Plenipotentiary on cultural mission to Europe and Latin 
			America (1960).
		</p>
		<p>
			Besides being a noted institution in politics and a staunch 
			nationalist, Recto was also a literary man and author of political 
			works and legal treaties.
		</p>
		<p>
			Senator Recto married Doña Aurora Reyes with whom he had five 
			children.
