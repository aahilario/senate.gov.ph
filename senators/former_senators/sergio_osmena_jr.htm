		<p>
			Like his venerable father, the late President Sergio Osmeña, 
			Serging, as he was called by his friends, was an astute politician, 
			a good friend, but an implacable enemy.

		<p>
			Sergio Osmeña Jr. was born in Cebu City on December 4, 1916 to 
			former Philippine President Sergio Osmeña Sr. and Estefania Veloso.
		</p>

			He graduated Associate of Arts cum laude at Ateneo de Manila on 1935 
			and Bachelor of Science in Commerce summa cum laude, New York 
			University in 1938.
		</p>
		<p>
			In 1951, he was elected provincial governor of Cebu and Cebu City 
			mayor for 3 terms- 1955, 1959 and 1963. Elected as congressman for 
			the second district of Cebu in 1958, his notable work as fiscalizer 
			brought him recognition from the Congressional Press Club which 
			voted him as one of the Ten Most Outstanding Congressmen of 1959. In 
			November 1965 elections, he won as Senator of the Philippines.
		</p>
		<p>
