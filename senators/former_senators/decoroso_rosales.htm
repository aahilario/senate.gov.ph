		<p>
			Senator Rosales was born on December 20, 1907 in Calbago, Calbayog 
			City to Basilio Rosales and Aqueda Ras.
		</p>
		<p>
			He finished Associate of Arts degree in 1920 and Bachelor of Laws 
			degree both from the University of the Philippines.
		</p>
		<p>
			In 1941, he was enmeshed in politics and for his political debut, he 
			was pitted against the then Secretary of Public Works, Jose Avelino, 
			who during the time, was Samar’s recognized political Kingpin. 
			Hardly Senator Rosales assumed the position of Representative of the 
			first district Samar and the dim of 1941 elections abated when Pearl 
			Harbor went up in smoke and so, Senator Rosales went back to Visayas 
			and join the resistance movement in Cebu to take charge of the Civil 
			Affairs of the province.
		</p>
		<p>
			In 1947, he ran against the son of his political enemy for the 
			governorship of Samar, but the glamour of the Roxas’ bandwagon and 
			the illusions it created in the minds of the newly-liberated 
			Philippines proved too much for the aging Osmeña. With the rest of 
			the Osmeña ticket Rosales lost his bid, only to stage a successful 
			comeback when in 1951, he bested Baltazar Avelino in a return match 
			for the gubernatorial seat of Samar. Once again he asserted his 
			leadership, but it was bitterly achieved. For shortly before Senator 
			Decoroso was persecuted by his political detractors. He was 
			incarcerated and denied bail... for defamation! In the face of all 
			these, Decoroso’s mother had a stroke. She died - her frail heart 
			having broken down with misery and woe.
		</p>
		<p>
			In 1953, he was elected as the Chairman of the League of Governors 
			and the City Mayors of the Philippines.
		</p>
		<p>
			In 1955, he was elected Senator for only a couple of years but he 
			was member of ten standing committees such as the Provincial and 
			Municipal Government and Chartered Cities.
		</p>
		<p>
			He was a delegate to the 1971 Constitutional Convention and headed 
			the Committee on Preamble, National Territory and Declaration of 
			Principles of the 1986 Constitutional Commission.
		</p>
		<p>
			He was married to Rosita Sepulveda with whom he had two children.
