		<p class="h1_bold">Jose Alejandrino</p>
		<p>
			Senator Jose Alejandrino was born to a wealthy couple from Arayat, 
			Pampanga on December 1,1870, in Binondo Manila.
		</p>
		<p>
			Senator Alejandrino obtained his education initially at the Ateneo 
			Municipal and, thereafter, at the University of Santo Tomas, where 
			he acquired a Bachelor of Arts degree. He pursued his studies in 
			Spain and at the University of Ghent in Belgium, where he 
			distinguished himself and brought honor to his country through his 
			superior academic performance. He graduated with a degree in 
			chemical engineering.
		</p>
		<p>
			While in Spain, he became an active member of the Propaganda 
			Movement. He joined the editorial staff of La Solidaridad. A close 
			friend of Jose Rizal, he was the one who brought the manuscript of 
			the El Filibusterismo to the printing press for publication.
		</p>
		<p>
			On November 21, 1896, several months after the Philippine Revolution 
			broke out, accompanied by Feliciano Jocson, he journeyed to Kawit, 
			Cavite, to seek a meeting with General Aguinaldo. Edilberto 
			Evangelista, his old schoolmate at the University of Ghent, had 
			proposed that he acquire the much-needed arms for the 
			revolutionaries from either China or Japan. He offered to undertake 
			the dangerous mission.
		</p>
		<p>
			When Aguinaldo accepted his offer, he proceeded to Hongkong, where 
			he helped organize the Revolutionary Council along with Felipe 
			Agoncillo, Jose Basa and Mariano Ponce. Much later, he became part 
			of the group in the Hong Kong Committee, which included Agoncillo 
			and Galicano Apacible, that staunchly advocated independence, as 
			opposed to the circle led by Jose Basa and Doroteo Cortes, who were 
			for annexing the country to the United States.
		</p>
		<p>
			From Hongkong he was able to dispatch to the revolutionaries in the 
			Philippines only dynamites and rifle pistons. Thus, in February 
			1897, he left Hongkong for Japan, to try to acquire more weapons and 
			supplies.
		</p>
		<p>
			In 1898, he served in the Malolos Congress that was first convoked 
			on September 15 by the revolutionary government. He became a member 
			of two crucial committees to draft the Constitution. On September 
			26, he was given the position of director of agriculture and 
			industry of the revolutionary administration. Later, he was 
			designated chief of the engineers of the army by President 
			Aguinaldo.
		</p>
		<p>
			When the Philippine-American War erupted, he affiliated with Gen. 
			Antonio Luna and his troops. Subsequently, as chief engineer, he 
			directed the building of trenches in several areas, including 
			Bulacan and Caloocan.
		</p>
		<p>
			He rose to the position of brigadier-general, and served as acting 
			secretary of war. He was also appointed commanding general of the 
			military operations in Central Luzon (in place of Gen. Pantaleon 
			Garcia), and military governor of Pampanga, replacing Gen. Maximino 
			Hizon, who had earlier been caught by the enemy. By then the 
			beleaguered government of Aguinaldo had been continuously hounded by 
			the pursuing American forces and pushed back to Tarlac.
		</p>
		<p>
			In September 1899, he headed the three-man commission charged with 
			releasing 13 American prisoners and holding talks with General Otis, 
			the commanding general of the American army in the Philippines, on 
			the suspension of hostilities. He was assisted by Lt. Col. Ramon 
			Soriano and Maj. Evaristo Ortiz. Later, he also conferred with Gen. 
			Arthur MacArthur, who had replaced Otis as chief of the American 
			forces. The two talked on the brutal, dehumanizing abuse of Filipino 
			civilians by American soldiers. Meanwhile, the revolutionaries 
			struggle was being debilitated by cowardly Filipinos whom 
			Alejandrino excoriated for treacherously collaborating with the 
			Americans.
		</p>
		<p>
			In May 1901, after much suffering and the tragic loss of countless 
			comrades in the field, he surrendered, in Arayat, to General 
			Funston. The latter initially refused his offer to surrender and, 
			instead, had him placed under arrest, demanding that he present a 
			certain American Negro, named Fagan, who was wanted for desertion. 
			Although he resisted Funston’s demand, Alejandrino was released the 
			next day.
		</p>
		<p>
			In August of the same year, he accepted from Gov. William H. Taft 
			the position of second city engineer of Manila, but discharged his 
			duties for not more than a year. He retired to lead a farmer’s life 
			until 1925, when he was designated senator for Sulu and Mindanao by 
			Gov. Gen. Leonard Wood. A member of the Partido Democrata Nacional, 
			he was elected representative of Pampanga’s second district to the 
			Constitutional Convention in 1934.
		</p>
		<p>
			Senator Alejandrino’s account of the Philippine Revolution against 
			Spain and the Philippine-American War, La Senda del Sacrificio, 
			tells of the noble revolutionaries and the lonely wars that they 
			fought in order to attain the national freedom.
		</p>
		<p>
			Senator Alejandrino died on June 1, 1951.
