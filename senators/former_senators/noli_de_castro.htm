		<p>
			Noli De Castro, garnered 16.1 million votes and emerged the number 
			one Senator in the last May 14, 2001 Election. The anchor of prime 
			time newscast TV Patrol, Vice President of DZMM and host of the very 
			popular Magandang Gabi Bayan, is a inarguably the country’s most 
			renowned and trusted news and current affairs program personality. 
			His exposes in Magandang Gabi… Bayan made the public aware of the 
			irregularities in the government and other significant sectors in 
			society. Such exposes paved the way for inquiries and investigation, 
			whish made those responsible individuals or groups accountable for 
			their actions.
		</p>
		<p>
			Most Popularly known as “Kabayan”, Senator De Castro is a 
			multi-awarded radio commentator, TV newscaster and public affairs 
			program host. Fearless, focused and committed, the newsman has 
			received a number of citations, recognition and prestigious awards 
			from different award-giving bodies and non-governmental 
			organizations like Mass Media Award, 7th and 9th KBP Golden Dove 
			Awards, KBP Awards, Dangerous Drugs Board.
		</p>
		<p>
			Senator De Castro does not merely reads news. He informs, provokes 
			reaction and debate, gives insights and at times even amuses. 
			Critics and competitors grudgingly concede to Senator De Castro’s 
			unprecedented success and prominence as country’s “nangunguna” in 
			broadcast journalism. Now as one of the country’s top senators, he 
			aims to correct all the problems he saw as a broadcaster and act on 
			all of the people’s concerns. Above all, he pledges his commitment 
			of being the “Boses ng Bayan sa Sendo”. Tenacity, Integrity, and 
			Credibility are his formula for success.
		</p>
		<p>
			And as one admirer aptly puts it, “It is simply difficult to imagine 
			a day without watching or listening to Senator Noli De Castro”.
