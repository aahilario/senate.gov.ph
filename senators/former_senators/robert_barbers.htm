			FROM ENFORCER TO LEGISLATOR
		</p>
		<p>
			Born in Surigao City, the young ROBERT ZABALA BARBERS already had 
			the makings of a good public servant and leader early on during his 
			student days. A consistent honor student, Barbers was always elected 
			to student councils and was always on hand to help and lead his 
			fellow students and friends.
		</p>
		<p>
			However, politics did not interest him and was not part of his plans 
			at that time. Instead, encouraged by his uncle, the distinguished 
			Police General and former Vice mayor of Manila, James Barbers, who 
			was then with the PNP-Western Police District, and influenced by his 
			readings of various mystery-detective novels, Robert Barbers took 
			and topped the examinations for enlistment in the Manila Police 
			Department. The rest is history.
		</p>
		<p>
			Starting as Patrolman, Barbers rose from the ranks of the Police 
			Service and came to be known as one of Manila’s finest police 
			officers. As a matter of fact, busting crooks and solving criminal 
			cases has gained for him numerous awards and commendations during 
			his twenty-seven (27) years as a law enforcer.
		</p>
		<p>
			His list of accomplishments as a police officer is certainly 
			impressive: adjudged for three consecutive years as one of the Ten 
			Outstanding Policemen of the Philippines (TOPP) from 1986 to 1998; 
			16 efficiency medals for solving major and sensational crimes; spot 
			promotions for the arrest of drug lord Don Jose Pepe Oyson and rebel 
			leaders Col. Billy Bibit and Ignacio Capegsan; medals of merit and 
			gallantry and commendations and letters from the U.S. State 
			Department and various embassies; and he was the first and only 
			Filipino Golden Service Awardee for Outstanding Law Enforcer in Asia 
			given in New York in 1991 – the list could go on and on.
		</p>
		<p>
			Barbers’ fame as a crime buster had even led to the making of a 
			bio-flick, “Bobby Barbers - Parak”, which showcased his exploits as 
			a no-nonsense policeman.
		</p>
		<p>
			Barbers was already an established name in law enforcement when 
			politics came knocking at his door. He formally entered the 
			political arena in 1992 as a member of the House of Representatives, 
			but still did his share to preserve peace and order in the country 
			as head of the House committee on Effective Law Enforcement and Vice 
			Chairman of the Committee on Public Order and Security.
		</p>
		<p>
			At the early stage of his political career, the then Representative 
			of the 2nd District of Surigao del Norte was recognized and 
			acclaimed for his outstanding performance as a legislator by various 
			institutions and organizations, including the Consumer Welfare 
			Foundation of the Philippines, University of the Philippines, 
			Gladiator Magazine, Pilipino Newsline, the Consumer’s Union of the 
			Philippines (PICC) and the National Defense College of the 
			Philippines, of which he is an alumnus.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Mindanao solon was so loved, respected and trusted by his 
			constituents that they re-elected him in 1996 unopposed. However, 
			his second term was cut short when he was appointed by then 
			President Fidel Ramos as Secretary of the Department of the Interior 
			and Local Government.
		</p>
		<p>
			As a member of the Cabinet, Barbers remained just as active in his 
			campaign against criminality, with his founding of the Public 
			Assistance and Reaction Against Crime (PARAC). It was also during 
			his stint as DILG Chief that he intensified his campaign against 
			illegal drugs. He established the Bring-A-Friend Project, which 
			worked for the voluntary submission of drug dependents for 
			rehabilitation. It was also during his time as DILG Secretary when 
			he founded the Barangay at Pulisya Laban sa Krimen (BPLK) Program 
			whose main purpose was to enlist the cooperation and active 
			participation of the civilian populace in the fight against all 
			forms of criminality.
		</p>
		<p>
			Moreover, Barbers added another feature to his cap when he was named 
			by the Social Weather Station (SWS) survey as the most effective, 
			most efficient and most popular Cabinet members of the Ramos 
			administration for five consecutive times.
		</p>
		<p>
			By the time the1998 national elections were approaching, Barbers was 
			already deemed as one of the “sure win” candidates for the Senate. 
			True enough, the Mindanao solon ranked fifth among the elected 
			Senators and became the first and, thus far, the only Police officer 
			who became a member of the Upper Chamber of Congress.
		</p>
		<p>
			As chairman of the Senate Committee on Public Order and Illegal 
			Drugs, Barbers continues to be a staunch crusader against all forms 
			of criminality, injustice and illegal drugs, which he considers as 
			the No. 1 enemy of the Filipino people. The neophyte Senator has 
			authored more than a hundred bills and resolutions, majority of 
			which are aimed at improving the country’s peace and order situation 
			and uplifting the living conditions of the Filipinos.
		</p>
		<p>
			Dedicated as he is to uphold the law and serve the people, Senator 
			Barbers said entering politics was not something he had planned. He 
			believes that his political career was providential, a part of God’s 
			plan for his life. Barbers however admits that police work remains 
			his first love.
		</p>
		<p>
			And for all his seemingly tough exterior, Barbers is a man with a 
			soft heart for the people, especially for the less fortunate. One 
			can see it in the number of people who come to the Senator’s office 
			to seek his assistance, ranging from job recommendations to legal 
			assistance as well as medical support. Dubbed as the Senate’s “faith 
			healer” due to the long queues of people in his office everyday, 
			Barber makes it a point to personally meet and hear the problems of 
			each visitor. The former DILG Chief is also a pious devotee of the 
			Santo Niño, as evidenced by the various icons of the Christ child 
			adorn his office. He credits the Santo Niño for every success, 
			including the criminal cases he has solved and all his electoral 
			victories. Because of his devotion to the Christ child, and being a 
			law enforcer, Barbers came up with a Santo Niño image dressed in 
			police uniform, which came to be known as the Sto. Niño de Policia.
		</p>
		<p>
			Senator Barbers is also a remarkable family man as he is a law 
			enforcer and legislator. It is easy to see that he has become a role 
			model for his four children, three of whom have also entered public 
			service, namely Congressman Robert Ace, who represents the 2nd 
			District of Surigao del Norte, Robert Dean, Councilor of Makati City 
			and Robert Lyndon who is the Regional Director of the Department of 
			Tourism for Metro Manila. And if there are two persons in this world 
			who serve as his inspiration, they are his wife, Virgie, and only 
			daughter, Mary Grace.
		</p>
		<p>
			The accolades and awards may keep on coming but for Barbers, such 
			things are not important. For him, being able to deliver the best 
			kind of public service to the Filipino people is what makes him a 
			complete man.
