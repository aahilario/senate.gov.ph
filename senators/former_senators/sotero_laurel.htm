		<p class="h1_bold">Sotero H. Laurel</p>
		<p>
			Sotero H. Laurel, like a long list of Laurels, is a nationalist and 
			a lawyer. His namesake and grandfather, Sotero, was also a lawyer 
			who worked with Apolinario Mabini and Marcelo H. del Pilar the 
			propaganda movement.
		</p>
		<p>
			Sotero earned his law degree at the University of the Philippines. 
			He pursued post - graduate studies at the University of Santo Tomas. 
			Later, at Harvard University he specialized in international and 
			constitutional law.
		</p>
		<p>
			Sotero laurel chose the classroom to share with aspiring law 
			students his vast knowledge of law. He lectured and reviewed bar 
			examinees on jurisprudence (the science and philosophy of human 
			law), constitutional and international law at the Far Eastern 
			University, Philippine Law School and Lyceum of the Philippines. As 
			its president, Laurel nursed the Lyceum into the leading training 
			ground of legal luminaries. He also founded a Lyceum branch in 
			Batangas.
		</p>
		<p>
			A leading Filipino educator, Laurel accents the need for an 
			educational system that would instill a “passionate commitment to 
			nationalism” among students. Laurel lamented that Filipino students 
			complete their schooling without developing a profound sense of 
			nationalism. Laurel realized that inculcating the awareness of 
			nationhood is a lengthy educational process.
		</p>
		<p>
			Laurel envisioned the introduction of legislation that would 
			reorient the educational curricula along nationalistic objective and 
			goals. He planned legislative proposals that will implement the 
			constitutional provision extending free education to high school 
			level. That includes delivering resources to fund free schooling of 
			high school students. Laurel is eyeing the possibility of tapping 
			part of the money spent on entertainment for education and human 
			resource development.
		</p>
		<p>
			His agenda for economic recovery rests on laws that would promote 
			productivity; distribute the just rewards of production to producers 
			and creation of job opportunities and other sources of livelihood.
