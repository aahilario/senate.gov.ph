		<p>
			Arturo Tolentino was born in Manila of humble parentage. A self-made 
			man, he is one of the best leaders in the legislative arm of the 
			government. His record in public service speaks for itself.
		</p>
		<p>
			As a student, Tolentino was noted for his excellent scholarship. He 
			was valedictorian of the Mapua High School (1928); valedictorian 
			(cum laude) University of the Philippines College of Law (1934); a 
			bar topnotcher (1934). He obtained the degree of Bachelor of 
			Philosophy (cum laude) with a gold medal award from the UP in 1938., 
			and received the degrees of Master of Law (meritissimus) and Doctor 
			of Civil Law (meritissimus) from the University of Santo Tomas.
		</p>
		<p>
			As a debater and orator, he won seven gold medals (including the 
			Quezon Medal) and two silver loving cups. He held the title of 
			“Inter-Collegiate Oratorical Champion of the Philippines” in 1934. 
			He successfully debated with American students from the University 
			of Oregon in 1933 and from the University of Washington in 1934.
		</p>
		<p>
			Tolentino has engaged in the practice of law since he passed the bar 
			in 1934, and is a recognized legal luminary.

			He has been a law professor in the UP, UST, UE, UM, Arellano 
			University, FEU, Manila Law College, Philippine Law School, San Beda 
			College and the Quezon College.

		<p>
			Tolentino was Congressman from 1949 to 1957 and was Senator from 
			1957 to 1972. He held the Senate Presidency from 1965 to 1966. Never 
			forgotten as a prominent statesman, he was reelected Senator in 1992 
			and served the term until 1995.

			Tolentino’s meritorious background and exceptional intellectual 
			abilities secured the government’s responsibility to the rules of 
			law in good hands. Respected not only for his extemporaneous 
			amendments to major measures and enlightened brand of politics, 
			Tolentino is also known among other thing as a scholar, writer, 
			diplomat, and distinguished author of law books. A recipient of 
			numerous awards, Tolentino is not only brilliant, but is also a man 
			of integrity and high principles.
