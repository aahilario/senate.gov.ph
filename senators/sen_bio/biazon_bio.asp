		<p align="justify"><b>Biography | <a href="biazon_resume.asp">Resume</a></b></p>
		<img border="1" src="../images/biazon.gif" width="151" height="200" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="3" />
		<p class="style1">Senator Rodolfo G. Biazon was 
		born on April 14, 1935 in Batac, Ilocos Norte. His father Rufino Biazon, 
		was a doughmaker then while his mother Juliana Gaspar, was a clotheswasher. 
		His father died and left him along with his mother and three younger sisters 
		when he was seven years old. At a young age of eight, he and his sisters 
		had already experienced great hardship, especially during the Japanese regime. 
		Like any other poor family during those times, Senator Biazon and family 
		had to work very hard to make ends meet. Living in a makeshift shanty in 
		Cavite, they had to peddle food, collected bottles and newspapers, which 
		were later sold in order to earn a living for the family. In spite of this 
		poverty, it did not stop him from obtaining his education.</p>
		<p class="style1">He enrolled as a Grade One 
		student at the age of eleven, in 1946. In order to support his education, 
		and at the same time look for ways to earn money to feed the family, he 
		went to school in the morning and worked in the afternoon. He would collect 
		seashells in Manila Bay which were in turn sold at the market. He studied 
		in Jose Rizal Elementary School, Pasay City, for his primary education where 
		he graduated salutatorian. He continued working, washing clothes for other 
		people in order to sustain his high school education at the Jose Abad Santos 
		High School located at the Arellano University, Pasay City in 1955. He also 
		graduated from this school with honors. He stopped doing laundry and instead 
		worked as a laborer in then Highway 54 now known as EDSA, this time to sustain 
		his college education in FEATI where he took mechanical engineering. </p>
		<p class="style1">Early in life, ‘Pong’, as he 
		is fondly called, has already shown his patriotism when he chose to enter 
		the Philippine Military Academy in 1957 despite having passed the examinations 
		in the West Point and the US Naval Academy. He then met Ms. Monserrat Narag 
		Bunoan whom he met through a classmate. Eight months after his graduation 
		in the Philippine Military Academy, he eventually married Monchie. They 
		had three children, Rita Rosanna, Rino Rudiyardo and Rozzano Rufino, who 
		are all successful in their own fields. He was the class goat of PMA Class 
		1961 yet this did not prevent him from achieving his goal. As a soldier, 
		he attained the following posts: Superintendent of PMA in 1986-87, Commandant 
		of the Philippine Marines in 1987-89, Commanding General of the NCR Defense 
		Command in 1988-90, Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) Vice Chief of 
		Staff in 1990-91 and AFP Chief of Staff in 1991. The most remarkable event 
		of his life as a soldier was when he was assigned in Davao in 1983. It was 
		there when he won back the trust and confidence of the civilians in the 
		military who were then perceived by the people to be oppressive and abusive.
		</p>
		<p class="style1">Senator Biazon attended other 
		trainings or schooling which include the TOP Management Program at the Asian 
		Institute of Management; Command and General Staff Course in Quantico, Virginia, 
		USA; Crisis Program in California, USA; Allied Combat Intelligence Course 
		in Okinawa, Japan; Senior Officer Maintenance Course in Kentucky, USA; Amphibious 
		Warfare Course in Quantico Virginia USA and, Military Instructors in Norfolk, 
		Virginia, USA. </p>
		<p class="style1">He became Senator in the Ninth 
		Congress from 1992 up to 1995. Paul Aquino, the brother of the late Senator 
		Ninoy Aquino was the one who convinced him to run for office. He was again 
		elected as Senator in 1998 and continues to serve his term up to this day. 
		Currently, he is the Chairman of the Senate Committee on National Defense 
		and Security and Committee on Urban Planning, Housing and Resettlement. 
		Aside from this, he holds the following positions in the Senate: Vice-Chair 
		of the Committees on Agriculture and Food and Foreign Relations, and a Member 
		of 15 other Senate Committees. He is also the President of the Asian Regional 
		Council Global Parliamentarians on Habitat, the Vice-President for Asia 
		Global Parliamentarians on Habitat, the Co-chairperson of PLCPD and a member 
		of the Commission on Appointments. </p>
		<p class="style1">As a Senator, he authored bills 
		which were enacted into law, some of which are: RA No. 9208 – Anti-Trafficking 
		in Persons Act of 2003, RA No. 9161 – Rental Reform Act of 2002, RA 7835-Comprehensive 
		and Integrated Shelter Finance Act, RA 7898-An Act providing for the Modernization 
		of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, RA 7742-An Act Amending PD1752 (Mandatory 
		Pag-ibig Membership), RA 7901-An Act Creating the CARAGA Region, RA 7889-An 
		Act Establishing the University of the Philippines Mindanao, RA 7863-The 
		Home Guaranty Corporation Law, RA 7691-Expanding the Jurisdiction of MTC’s, 
		MCTC and METC, Joint Resolution NO. 7-Increasing the Subsistence Allowance 
		of Soldiers and Policemen, RA 8763-Home Guarantee Corporation Act of 2000, 
		RA 9040-An Act Exempting from the Tax Certain Allowances and Benefits granted 
		to the members of the AFP, and RA 9049-An Act Granting Monthly Gratuity 
		and Privileges to an Awardee of the Medal of Valor. </p>
		<p class="style1">Senator Rodolfo G. Biazon continues 
		to draft bills which center on providing low cost housing and advocating 
		bills for the benefit of our soldiers. His value for hard work and perseverance 
		make him a man to be revered and a legislator deserving of the mandate given 
		to him by the people.</p>
