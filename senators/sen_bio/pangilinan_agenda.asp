											Biography</a> | 
						<a href="pangilinan_resume.asp">Resume</a> | Agenda</b></p>
			        <p style="text-align: justify"><b>Work for accountable and 
					responsive government </b></p>
			        <p style="text-align: justify">
					A respected American politician once said that all politics 
					is local. I believe that all government is local. This is 
					because government must not be some faceless, nameless 
					bureaucracy alien from its constituents. It must be a 
					living, breathing presence in the lives of people. It must 
					be responsive to the people’s needs and sensitive to their 
					plight. Thus, government must be as near to the people as 
					possible. This, I believe is the essence of good governance. 
					My experience as councilor of Quezon City has convinced me 
					that this is the best way government can make a positive 
					impact on the lives of ordinary citizens. For this reason, I 
					shall commit myself to strengthening local government units 
					(LGU’s) during my term. To bring government closer to the 
					people, specially in the provinces, I shall explore the 
					possibility of adopting a federal system of government. As 
					the basic unit of our government, barangays should be 
					empowered to, among others, improving the barangay justice 
					system. I shall also push for amendments in the local 
					government code that shall bring about these objectives.<br /><br /><b>
			        Revitalize the judicial system and promote human rights 
			        </b></p>
			        <p style="text-align: justify">
					A lawyer is taught that he is a high priest in the temple of 
					justice. Lawyers are officers of the court, tasked with the 
					solemn duty of aiding the courts in the administration of 
					justice. Sadly, our courts system is not the last bastion of 
					justice that it was meant to be. It is common knowledge the 
					wheels of justice grind exceedingly slow, as litigants 
					bewail the tedious proceedings and the snails pace for 
					resolving court cases. On top of this, our courts have 
					developed the reputation as being graft-ridden and many of 
					our judges as hoodlums in robes, thus resulting in an 
					erosion of our people’s confidence in the judiciary. Judges 
					and court employees complain of being overworked and 
					underpaid. </p>
			        <p style="text-align: justify">
					Aware of these threats, and realizing the paramount 
					importance of the judiciary in our system of government, I 
					shall push for measures to improve the compensation and 
					working conditions for all members of the judicial branch. 
					In line with this, I shall work for a greater budget for the 
					judiciary. </p>
			        <p style="text-align: justify">
					Respect for human rights is a bedrock principle in our 
					Constitution. Our national experience under martial law has 
					taught us of the painful lessons and dire consequences of 
					suppressing and trampling upon fundamental human rights. As 
					a lawyer and Senator, I am firmly committed to strengthening 
					our democracy through vigilance in the protection and 
					promotion of human rights. In this regard, I shall work 
					toward strengthening the Commission on Human Rights and 
					promoting human rights education among our police and law 
					enforcers, among other measures.<br /><br /><b>
			        Strengthen the Filipino family. Empower the Filipino youth. </b></p>
			        <p style="text-align: justify">
					We Filipinos are family oriented, and with good reason. For 
					it is through our families that we first taught good values 
					that we carry through life. It is in our homes that we 
					receive guidance, support, love and protection. I should 
					know. I grew up in a large and close knit family that 
					thrived on love and caring. It was in our home that my 
					ideals of service were nurtured. </p>
			        <p style="text-align: justify">
					Now that I have a family of my own, I would like my child to 
					be brought up in the same way that I was reared. This is 
					also my dream for all Filipino children and their families. 
					Therefore, I am committed to strengthen the family as the 
					basic unit in our society and to work so that it can retain 
					its role as the place where our children are molded and 
					trained in to the values we Filipinos cherish. </p>
			        <p style="text-align: justify">
					In line with this thrust, I intend to introduce legislation 
					that shall support and enhance family welfare. Closely 
					connected with this, I shall introduce measures on a variety 
					of important issues that have significant impact on the 
					family, such as employment generation, job security, 
					overseas Filipino workers, responsible parenthood and family 
					planning. </p>
			        <p style="text-align: justify">
					The great Filipino patriot Jose Rizal pointed to the youth 
					as the hope of the fatherland. Ours is a nation of young 
					people who form the overwhelming majority of the population. 
					As a student leader, I have worked for affordable, quality 
					and relevant education. I have pushed for student’s rights 
					and welfare. I intend to pursue these goals as a Senator. 
					Toward this end, I shall advocate for the improvement of the 
					public school system, upgrade the condition of teachers and 
					provide equal educational opportunities for all our youth, 
					especially those in the countryside.</p>
						<p style="text-align: justify">
					Push for livable communities. Advocate urban renewal and 
					transformation. </p>
			        <p style="text-align: justify">
					It is estimated that in the future majority of our 
					population shall be city dwellers. In fact, Metro Manila 
					alone is home to 10 million of our people. Despite this, 
					Metro Manila and other key cities suffer from congestion, 
					pollution, traffic jams, severe lack of social services and 
					high crime rates. </p>
			        <p style="text-align: justify">
			        Development, to be truly meaningful, must manifest itself at 
					the grassroots in the form of vibrant, clean, peaceful and 
					progressive communities. It is my vision to transform our 
					urban centers into livable and “walkable” communities, where 
					people are safe and social services are accessible. </p>
			        <p style="text-align: justify">
					To realize this, I shall endeavor to reduce travel time from 
					homes to workplaces by rationalizing urban transport 
					systems. I shall strive to provide quality and affordable 
					housing for the typical employee through an invigorated 
					housing policy that will mobilize private investors to close 
					the housing gap. I shall push for legislation to develop 
					“walkable” urban communities where basic social services are 
					a walk away from home. I shall work to decongest our urban 
					centers by addressing rural poverty in order to stem the 
					tide of migration into our cities. In line with this, I 
					shall propose legislation to build rural capacities for 
					sustainable economic progress. </p>
						<p style="text-align: justify">
					This is my agenda in the Senate. This is what I hope to 
					achieve. I am aware that this agenda is not a comprehensive 
					solution to the complex issues that confront our nation. I 
					believe this is just the first step to address the many 
					concerns that confront us. It is merely the start of 
					completing the historic task of building a nation that we 
					can be proud of. </p>
			        <p style="text-align: justify">
					I do not have any illusions that I can realize this dream 
					alone. I have always believed that the task of nation 
					building will not be realized by a single leader posing as a 
					messiah, but by the collective effort of Filipinos, 
					possessed of a single vision, united by a common goal and 
					giving the best of themselves in this grand undertaking.</p>
						<p style="text-align: justify">
					I am sure that my dream for our country is shared by all 
					Filipinos, for it is the deepest desire of our people to 
					have a secure life for themselves and for their children, to 
					see their nation rise up from the morass of poverty and 
					despair. It is the same dream that animated Rizal and his 
					colleagues, the same vision that obsessed the great leaders 
					of our land. It is the same dream that we still pursue 
					today. <br />Our finest hours have been those times when Filipinos came 
					together to reach for a better future. Our history is 
					replete with instances when ordinary people came together, 
					putting aside their differences for the sake of the common 
					good. In our lifetime, we had EDSA 1 and 2, shining examples 
					of what our united people can accomplish. They are our 
					testimonies to the greatness of the Filipino spirit. </p>
			        <p style="text-align: justify">
					But this task is far from over. To be sure, we have already 
					won many battles, but the war against the ills of our 
					society still rages. And so we are called to come together 
					and, like our forefathers, dedicate our lives to this 
					mission. It is now our generation’s turn to complete the 
					task begun by our heroes and our forbears: to build a nation 
					we can be proud of.
			        </p>
			        <p style="text-align: justify">
					The times call for the formation of a political organization 
					that shall embody our vision and ideals. In a country where 
					politics is reviled as dirty and corrupt, it shall become a 
					center for alternative political leadership and fresh 
					political insights. This leadership shall be grounded on 
					morality, transparency, and professionalism and the desire 
					to promote for the common good. As opposed to a politics 
					founded on personality and entertainment, it shall offer 
					concrete and viable programs of action. It shall draw its 
					members from among the ranks of the finest and most 
					dedicated sectors of society, the middle class, businessmen, 
					professionals, teachers, government personnel, students and 
					all those sincerely striving for a better Philippines. It 
					shall be a popular movement spread out in across the 
					country. It shall be the vehicle that shall realize our 
					vision. </p>
			        <p style="text-align: justify">
					Our country is on the threshold of change. The people are 
					fed up with the way things are at present. They are crying 
					for change. 
			        </p>
			        <p style="text-align: justify">
					We shall make this change happen. This will be our life’s 
					work. This will be our legacy to history.</p>						<p class="backtotop"><img src="/images/backtotop.gif" />
