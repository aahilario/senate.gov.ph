																																Backed by the support and trust of his peers in the chamber, Senator Enrile as the Senate President on 17 November 2008.  In all humility, he accepted the responsibility entrusted to him, saying that “To lead the Senate with its great minds, strong advocacies, varying and independent political beliefs and leanings, is not an easy task. But it is precisely this variance in points of view and the battle of great ideas that provide the dynamism we need to craft legislation that takes into account and balances the competing interests involved – with the end in view of serving the greater good of the people to whom we owe our mandate.”
 
</p>

First was in December 2009 to take up Proclamation No. 1959 of the previous administration, declaring a state of martial law and suspending the writ of habeas corpus in the province of Maguindanao, while the second occasion was in May 2010, when Congress convened to constitute itself as the national canvassing board to canvass the votes for president and vice president, and thereafter proclaim the winners.    

</p>
			<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">
								Now on his fourth term in the Senate, Senate President s to “discharge my duties and responsibilities with honor, with total devotion to our institution, and with fairness to all members.  No partisan consideration will blur or color the treatment of any member of the Senate.  We are all Senators elected by the people to serve them with dedication to their interest and well-being and devotion to our responsibilities.”  Furthermore, in his acceptance speech, he enjoined his colleagues to “uphold the independence and integrity of this Senate, without abandoning our duty to cooperate with the other departments of the government to achieve what is good for our people.” 

</p>
			<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">
