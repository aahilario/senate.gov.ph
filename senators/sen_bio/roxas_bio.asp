        						Biography</b></p>

											<img border="1" src="../images/roxas.gif" width="151" height="200" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="3" />
								<p class="style2">&#39;Mr. Palengke&#39; is Senator MAR Roxas, the son 
								of the illustrious Senator Gerry Roxas, and the 
								grandson of the venerable President Manuel Roxas 
								whose public service careers have greatly 
								benefited the country. MAR graduated from the 
								Ateneo de Manila University in 1974 and the 
								Wharton School of Economics at the University of 
								Pennsylvania in 1979. Before entering public 
								service, MAR worked as an investment banker, 
								mobilizing venture capital funds for Small and 
								Medium Enterprises.</p>
			<p class="style2">MAR&#39;s public service life began in the House of Representatives 
			in 1993. After his congressional stint, he was appointed as 
			Secretary of the Department of Trade and Industry; and then in 2004, 
			he was elected to the Senate with a staggering 20 million votes, the 
			largest ever obtained by a candidate in any Philippine election.</p>
			<p class="style2">Owing to his record of accomplishments as a public servant and 
			political leader, the international community described MAR as &quot;one 
			of the young leaders in politics and business who will bring Asia 
			and the Pacific to the forefront of world affairs.&quot; At the World 
			Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, MAR was named as &quot;one of the 
			Global Leaders of Tomorrow who is expected to shape the future.&quot; 
			Recently, the Singapore Government has awarded him as the 16th Lee 
			Kuan Yew Fellow.</p>
			<p class="style2"><strong>Majority Leader of the House of Representatives</strong></p>
			<p class="style2">MAR joined the government in 1993 as a Congressman representing 
			the 1st District of Capiz. He later became Majority Leader of the 
			House of Representatives.</p>
			<p class="style2">As a congressman, MAR espoused consumer protection, underscoring 
			the right of every Filipino to affordable medicines, as his personal 
			advocacy. His landmark laws include, among others:</p>
			<ul class="style4">
				<li>
				RA 8759 - establishing in all municipalities a Public 
				Employment Service Office which serves as employment 
				facilitation and information center, and links all job 
				opportunities within the region;
				</li>
				<li>
				RA 8748 - amending the Special Economic Zone Act by directly 
				allocating to the municipality or city 2% (out of the 5%) gross 
				tax to be collected from the establishments operating in the 
				ecozone and providing for disturbance compensation for persons 
				to be displaced or evicted by publicly-owned ecozones;
				</li>
				<li>
				RA 8756 - incentivizing the establishment of regional 
				headquarters to encourage investment and operation of 
				multinational companies in the country and to generate more 
				jobs.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="style2">MAR&#39;s stint in the House is most noted for his principal 
			authorship of RA 7880, also known as the Roxas Law, which ensures 
			fair distribution of the education capital budget among all the 
			provinces. This gave life to his advocacy for fair and equitable 
			access to education, free from regional bias and political patronage 
			considerations.</p>
			<p class="style2"><strong>Mr. Palengke in DTI</strong></p>
			<p class="style2">In 2000, MAR served as Trade and Industry Secretary. During his 
			four-year stint, he pushed for the development of the &quot;palengke&quot; as 
			the basic unit of the economy and the root of progress, staunchly 
			advocating not only consumer welfare and protection but also sound 
			trade and investment policies, particularly SME development.</p>
			<p class="style3"><strong>Education</strong>. MAR intensified his commitment to quality education 
			through the Personal Computers for Public Schools (PCPS) Program, 
			which distributed over 30,000 computers to 2,000 public high schools 
			all over the country. PCPS computers provided some 500,000 high 
			school students with the necessary ICT tools and skills.</p>
			<p class="style3"><strong>Trade</strong>. MAR&#39;s work regarding trade policy was highlighted during the 
			2003 WTO Meeting in Cancun, Mexico, where he fought for increased 
			market access for Philippine exports, particularly agricultural 
			products and a rationalized Philippine trade regime so domestic 
			industries would not be unduly harmed.<br />
			<br />
			<strong>Information Technology</strong>. Hailed as the &#39;Father of the Call Center and 
			Business Process Outsourcing Industries&#39;, MAR saw and harnessed the 
			potential of the Philippines as a global e-services hub. He launched 
			&#39;Make IT Philippines&#39; and organized the first IT-enabled services 
			(ITES) to the US which inevitably led to the biggest global industry 
			names to invest in the country, thereby creating thousands of jobs 
			for Filipino IT workers.</p>
			<p class="style3">MAR pioneered the establishment of high-technology industry centers 
			and the promotion of the business process outsourcing (BPO) market 
			in the country, particularly call center operations, hence providing 
			jobs and incomes to Filipinos. From a mere 2000 jobs at the onset, 
			the BPO industry now provides hundreds of thousands of jobs, thereby 
			putting the Philippines on the map as a major IT/BPO destination.</p>
			<p class="style3"><strong>Jobs</strong>. MAR worked for the reopening of the National Steel Corporation 
			which provided thousands of jobs, income and livelihood to Iligan 
			City, Northern Mindanao and adjacent regions. He also launched the 
			Garment Export Industry Transformation Plan and Assistance Package 
			to enhance the competitiveness of the industry and ensure its 
			viability and vibrancy beyond 2004. Moreover, he initiated the 
			Motor/Vehicle Development Program to promote exports, create a 
			viable market base for our car manufacturers and secure jobs for our 
			workers.</p>
			<p class="style3"><strong>MSMEs</strong>. Believing that micro, small and medium enterprises or MSMEs 
			serve as the prime engine for job generation, MAR pushed for MSME 
			development through the SULONG (SMEs Unified Lending Opportunities 
			for National Growth) Program, which granted almost P26.7 billion on 
			low-interest loans to 281,229 SMEs on its first year.</p>
			<p class="style3"><strong>Consumer Welfare</strong>. MAR promoted the Tamang Timbang, Tamang Presyo 
			program for consumers to get the &quot;full and best value for their 
			money&quot;; the Presyong Tama, Gamot Pampamilya to make affordable and 
			quality medicines accessible to Filipinos, and Pinoy Pandesal, 
			Palengke ng Bayan, among others. These programs promoted supply 
			chain efficiencies leading to growth and productivity, and a wide 
			range of opportunities and long-term gains.</p>
			<p class="style3">Being the proponent of the philosophy of &#39;palengkenomics&#39;, which 
			considers the palengke as the economy&#39;s weathervane and the mirror 
			by which its over-all health can be seen and measured, MAR to this 
			day continues to conduct weekly monitoring of the prices of prime 
			commodities and maintains strong linkages with suppliers, traders, 
			and vendors in the different wet markets.</p>
			<p class="style3">&quot;Price is an important economic indicator. It is a crucial 
			determinant of activity in the market place,&quot; he said.</p>
			<p class="style2"><strong>Consumerist crusade continues at the Senate</strong></p>
			<p class="style2">MAR&#39;s consumerist crusade continues with his authorship of Senate 
			Bill No. 2139, which seeks to lower the cost of medicines by 
			amending the Intellectual Property Code of the Philippines. With the 
			approval of this bill, prices of quality medicines are expected to 
			drop resulting in savings for the poor, and better health for all.</p>
			<p class="style2">MAR resolved to protect consumers from defective and substandard 
			products. Thus, he initiated inquiries, with the end in view of 
			strengthening the Consumer Code of the Philippines, on such 
			legislative proposals as the &#39;Lemon Law&#39;, proper labeling of milk, 
			toys, and food products containing genetically modified organisms 
			(GMOs), and stronger safeguards against pyramiding and other similar 
			scams.</p>
			<p class="style2">As chairperson of the Senate Committees on Trade and Commerce and on 
			Economic Affairs and as co-chairperson of the Congressional 
			Oversight Committee on the Electronic Commerce Law, MAR continued to 
			nurse the economy back to robust health through education, 
			information technology, job creation, and development of small and 
			business enterprises.</p>
			<p class="style2">When the pre-need industry succumbed to a mismanagement-spawned 
			financial crisis, which threatened to wipe out the investments of 
			thousands of consumers in pre-need plans, he filed a bill, the 
			Pre-Need Act of 2005, to improve and strengthen industry regulation 
			and safeguard consumer interest. MAR&#39;s leadership at the time 
			provided pre-need plan holders a veritable lifeline.</p>
			<p class="style2">For MAR, the exercise of public leadership entails accountability 
			and transparency which should bring about people empowerment. He has 
			called for a paradigm shift in policy-making, rejecting 
			incrementalism, or the tingi mentality, which has resulted to &#39;doing 
			a little bit of everything to please a little bit of everyone.&#39;</p>
			<p class="style2">&quot;People can hardly feel the impact of incrementalism. Government 
			must target the people&#39;s most pressing concerns and focus its 
			resources on completely addressing these problems. We can&#39;t be doing 
			what we used to do in the past simply because if we did, there is no 
			reason to expect that the future would be any different,&quot; he said.</p>
			<p class="style2">He complements his youth and dynamism by listening to the voices of 
			the common Filipino, reaching out to them through personal 
			interaction, the media, and various IT tools. His website, 
			<a href="http://www.marroxas.com">www.marroxas.com</a>, is a sampler of his IT inclination, an interactive 
			site that dispenses user-friendly information and serves as 
			repository of public sentiment.</p>
			<p class="style2">MAR has distinguished himself as a public servant in his own unique 
			way, following the imprints of his forbears yet with the courage and 
			competence to carve his own path as a national leader.</p>						<p class="backtotop"><img src="/images/backtotop.gif" />
