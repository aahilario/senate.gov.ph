			      As the eldest son of President 
					Joseph Marcelo Ejercito Estrada and Senator Luisa 
					Pimentel-Ejercito Estrada, it is not surprising that like 
					his parents, the Filipino masses have a special place in the 
					heart of Senator Jinggoy Ejercito Estrada, along with 
					siblings, Jacqueline Ejercito-Lopez and Jude Ejercito.</p>
						<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">
			      In 1989, he was married to Ma. 
					Presentacion &quot;Precy&quot; Vitug-Ejercito whom he was blessed with 
					four wonderful and beautiful children, namely, Janella 
					Marie, Joseph Luis Manuel, Julian Emilio and baby Julienne.</p>
						<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">
			      Having witnessed how his famous 
					and well-loved father, former Mayor of the historical town 
					of San Juan has satisfactorily governed said locality over a 
					progressive nineteen year period (1967-1986), Jinggoy knows 
					that he is bound to follow the footsteps that his father has 
					carved in both public service and show business arena.</p>
						<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">
			      In his early 20s, Jinggoy became 
					an actor and bagged the Filipino Academy for Movie Art and 
					Science (FAMAS) Best Supporting Actor Award for his 
					performance in the movie entitled &quot;Farita Punzalan Story&quot;. 
					In 1999, he also became the host of the television public 
					service program, SaBAYAN, which has helped a number of 
					Filipinos through significant expos√©s.</p>
						<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">
			      Senator Jinggoy finished his 
					primary and secondary education at the Ateneo de Manila 
					University and earned a degree in A.B. Economics from the 
					University of the Philippines. He took up Bachelor of Laws 
					for four (4) years at the Lyceum University while serving as 
					Vice-Mayor at the Municipality of San Juan at a young age of 
					25. In 1992, he became the youngest ever elected-local chief 
					executive in the entire nation at age 29. For three (3) 
					consecutive terms, he administered the economic, social, 
					political, and cultural affairs of the Municipality of San 
					Juan beyond everyone&#39;s expectations. He spearheaded various 
					projects and programs for the improvement of the said 
					municipality in the form of - construction of modernized 
					Barangay Halls with Day Care Centers in all Barangays, 
					repair and renovation of the now San Juan National High 
					School, and other public elementary schools, recreation 
					centers like gymnasiums, basketball courts and play grounds 
					and the creation of different livelihood centers, 
					improvement and replacement of drainages, concreting of 
					municipal roads and the construction of a four-storey San 
					Juan Medical Center and the San Juan Municipal Gymnasium. 
					During his incumbency, San Juan gained the reputation of 
					being one of the most progressive municipalities and the 
					Most Peaceful Municipality in the Philippines.</p>
						<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">
			      During his final tenure as 
					Mayor, he was sworn into office as the National President of 
					the League of Municipalities of the Philippines from 1998 to 
					2001, where he efficiently harnessed the potential of local 
					government units as reliable partner of the national 
					government in nation-building through his programs on 
					continuous empowering of the LGUs by securing and producing 
					better service facilities to at least 1,525 municipalities 
					during his stint.</p>
						<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">
			      In May 2004, the Filipino people 
					gave the &quot;Anak ng Masa&quot; an official mandate to serve as 
					Senator of the Republic of the Philippines (2004-2010). This 
					gave him the chance to carry out his earnest desire to 
					continue the pro-poor programs that his father has started 
					and to pursue his commitment to address the problems 
					besetting the country through just and meaningful 
					legislations. <br /><br />As the Chairman of the Senate 
					Committee on Labor, Employment and Human Resources, Senator 
					Jinggoy Ejercito Estrada is presently tasked with the study 
					and deliberations on measures relating to labor; human 
					resources development; maintenance of industrial peace; 
					promotion of employer-employee cooperation; labor education, 
					standards and statistics; organization of the labor market 
					including recruitment, training and placement of workers and 
					exports of human resources; foreign workers in the 
					Philippines; promotion and development of workers&#39; 
					organization as well as employment-intensive technology. He 
					also chairs the Congressional Oversight Committee on Labor 
					and Employment (COCLE).</p>
						<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">
			      His other committee assignments 
					include: Accounts, Agriculture and Food, Blue Ribbon, 
					Energy, Foreign Relations, Local Government, National 
					Defense, Public Order and Illegal Drugs, Rules, Peace, 
					Unification and Reconciliation, Urban Planning, Housing and 
					Resettlement, Ways and Means. He is the Vice Chairman of the 
					Committee on Games, Amusement and Sports and the Committee 
					on Public Information and Mass Media. He also serves as a 
					member of the Commission on Appointments.</p>
						<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">
			      The good Senator introduced two 
					hundred eighty-nine (289) bills and resolutions, two hundred 
					forty-nine (249) of which were primarily authored by him. 
					His current priority bills are geared towards improving and 
					strengthening the policies affecting our workforce and 
					overseas foreign workers, empowering our local government 
					units, protecting and preserving our freedom of expression 
					and assembly, and promotion of youth welfare. At present, he 
					ranks fourth (4th) among the list of Senators with the most 
					number of proposed legislations filed in the Upper House.</p>
						<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">
			      Senator Jinggoy Ejercito Estrada 
					has actively participated in the deliberations on various 
					measures during committee hearings and plenary sessions. He 
					has successfully sponsored and steered the passage on Third 
					Reading of the National Labor Relations Commission Bill 
					which rationalizes the composition and functions of said 
					Commission in order to improve its administrative and 
					operational efficiency, particularly on the issue concerning 
					the speedy disposition of labor cases filed. He contributed 
					to the refinement of certain measures particularly that of 
					the UP Charter, Human Rights Victims Compensation Act, 
					Amendments to the National Internal Revenue Code on E-Vat 
					and the Excise Tax, National Budget, Synchronized Barangay 
					and SK Elections, Ratification of the International Labour 
					Organization Convention on Forced Labor and the Mandatory 
					Hepatitis-B Immunization.</p>
						<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">
			      Since his assumption to office, 
					the Senator has delivered a total of seventeen (17) 
					privilege speeches on varied issues such as the 
					constitutionally guaranteed rights on freedom of speech, 
					expression and right to public assembly, anomalous 
					transactions and operations of Philippine Amusement and 
					Gaming Corporation (PAGCOR), wiretapping scandal, and abuses 
					of power by the current administration.</p>
						<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">
			      Presently, Senator Jinggoy 
					Ejercito Estrada is very much focused in keeping his 
					commitment to the Filipino masa to do his very best as a 
					legislator and as a public servant in securing a future far 
					better than what we are all made to contend with, today.</p>						<p class="backtotop"><img src="/images/backtotop.gif" />
