						Article VI, Section 2 of the Constitution provides:</p>
						<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">The Senate 
						shall be composed of twenty-four Senators who shall 
						be&nbsp;elected at large by the qualified voters of the 
						Philippines, as may be provided by law.
						</p>
						<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">It is 
						worthy to note that the composition of the Senate is 
						smaller in number as compared to the House of 
						Representatives. The members of this chamber are elected 
						at large by the entire electorate. The rationale for 
						this rule intends to make the Senate a training ground 
						for national leaders and possibly a springboard for the 
						presidency. It follows also that the Senator, having a 
						national rather than only a district constituency, will 
						have a broader outlook of the problems of the country, 
						instead of being restricted by narrow viewpoints and 
						interests. With such perspective, the Senate is likely 
						to be more circumspect, or at least less impulsive, than 
						the House of Representatives.</p>
						<p align="justify" class="h3_uline"><a name="Qualifications_to_Become_Senators"></a>Qualifications to Become Senators</p>
						<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">The 
						qualifications for membership in the Senate are 
						expressly stated in Section 3, Art. VI of the 
						Constitution as follows:</p>
						<blockquote>
							<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">No 
							person shall be a Senator unless he is a 
							natural-born citizen of the Philippines, and on the 
							day of the election, is at least thirty-five years 
							of age, able to read and write, a registered voter, 
							and a resident of the Philippines for not less than 
							two years immediately preceding the day of the 
							election.</p>
							<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">It is 
							worthy to note that the age is fixed at 35 and must 
							be possessed on the day of the elections, that is, 
							when the polls are opened and the votes cast, and 
							not on the day of the proclamation of the winners by 
							the board of canvassers. </p>
							<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">With 
							regard to the residence requirement, it was ruled in 
							the case of Lim v. Pelaez&nbsp; that it must be the 
							place where one habitually resides and to which he, 
							after absence, has the intention of returning. </p>
							<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">The 
							enumeration laid down by the Constitution is 
							exclusive under the Latin principle of expressio 
							unius est exclusio alterius. This means that 
							Congress cannot anymore add additional 
							qualifications other than those provided by the 
							Constitution.</p>

											Organization of the Senate</p>
						<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">Under the 
						Constitution, “Congress shall convene once every year on 
						the fourth Monday of July for its regular session...”. 
						During this time, the Senate is organized to elect its 
						officers. Specifically, the Constitution provides a 
						definite statement, to wit: </p>
						<blockquote>
							<p align="justify">The Senate shall elect its 
							President and the House of Representatives its 
							Speaker by a majority vote of all its respective 
							members. </p>
							<p align="justify">Each House shall choose such

							<p align="justify">x x x </p>
							<p align="justify">(3) Each House may determine the

						</blockquote>
						<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">By virtue 
						of these provisions of the Constitution, the Senate 
						adopts its own rules, otherwise known as the “Rules of 
						the Senate.” The Rules of the Senate provide the 
						following officers: a President, a President Pro 
						Tempore, a Secretary and a Sergeant-at-Arms. </p>
						<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">Following 
						this set of officers, the Senate as an institution can 
						then be grouped into the Senate Proper and the 
						Secretariat. The former belongs exclusively to the 
						members of the Senate as well as its committees, while 
						the latter renders support services to the members of 
						the Senate.</p>						<p class="backtotop"><img src="/images/backtotop.gif" />

								<p align="justify"><b>1. The Senate President </b></p>
								<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">
								Widely regarded as the most powerful figure in 
								the Senate, the Senate President is the 
								presiding officer of the Senate as well as the 
								leader of the majority group. Under the 
								Constitution, the Senate President is regarded 
								as third in line of succession, after the 
								President and Vice-President.</p>
								<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">
								Under Section 3 of Rule III of the Rules of the 
								Senate, the Senate President is the Chief 
								Executive of the Senate. His duties and powers 
								are as follows: </p>
								<blockquote>
									<p align="justify">(a) To preside over the 
									sessions of the Senate on the days and at 
									the hours designated by it; to call the 
									Senate to order and, if there is a quorum, 
									to order the reading of the Journal of the 
									preceding session and, after the Senate

									<p align="justify">(b) To decide all points

									<p align="justify">(c) To sign all measures,

									resolutions of the Senate are complied with; </p>
									<p align="justify">(e) To have general 
									control over the session hall, the 
									antechambers, corridors and offices of the 
									Senate; </p>
									<p align="justify">(f) To maintain order in 
									the session hall, the antechambers,

									appropriate measures to quell it; </p>
									<p align="justify">(g) To designate an

									<p align="justify">(i) To dismiss any 
									employee for cause, which dismissal in the 
									case of permanent and classified employees

									<p align="justify">(j) To diminish or 
									increase the number of authorized personnel

									amount earmarked therein. </p>
								</blockquote>
								<p align="justify"><b>2. The Senate President 
								Pro Tempore</b></p>
								<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">
								Like the President of the Senate, the Senate 
								President Pro Tempore is also elected by the 
								members of the Senate. In the U.S., by custom, 
								he is the most senior member of the majority 
								party. Although it is not exclusively followed 
								here, for sometime in the past Senates, senior 
								members of the majority party are often elected 
								as Senate President Pro Tempore. Under Section 4 
								of Rule IV of the Rules of the Senate, the 
								President Pro Tempore shall discharge the powers 
								and duties of the President in the following 
								cases: </p>
								<blockquote>
									<p align="justify">(a) When the President is 
									absent for one or more days; </p>
									<p align="justify">(b) When the President is 
									temporarily incapacitated; and </p>
									<p align="justify">(c) In the event of the 
									resignation, removal, death or absolute 
									incapacity of the President.
									</p>
								</blockquote>
								<p align="justify"><b>3. The Majority Leader </b></p>
								<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">In 
								the modern Senate, the second in command is the 
								majority leader, whose primary responsibility is 
								to manage the legislative affairs of the 
								chamber. While nothing in the Rules of the 
								Senate expressly states the powers of the 
								Majority Leader, to a great extent, he is very 
								influential in the passage of bills. As the 
								traditional Chairman of the Committee on Rules, 
								the Majority Leader helps formulate, promote, 
								negotiate and defend the majority’s legislative 
								program, particularly on the floor. </p>
								<p align="justify"><b>4. The Minority Leader </b></p>
								<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">The 
								minority group chooses from among themselves the 
								Minority Leader who is considered as the titular 
								head of the minority in the Senate and 
								oftentimes called a “shadow president.” </p>
								<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">In 
								many past rigodons of the Senate or the 
								so-called Senate “coups,” sometimes the minority 
								leader becomes the President and the ousted 
								President becomes the minority leader. </p>
								<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">The 
								basic duties of the Minority Leader is that he 
								becomes the spokesman for his party or group or 
								coalition and enunciates its policies. He is 
								expected to be alert and vigilant in defense of 
								the minority’s rights. It is his function and 
								duty to criticize constructively the policies 
								and programs of the majority, and to this end 
								employ parliamentary tactics and give close 
								attention to all proposed legislation. </p>
								<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">The 
								Rules of the Senate gives the President Pro 
								Tempore and the Majority and Minority Leaders 
								unique privileges as all are ex-officio members 
								of all the permanent committees of the Senate.</p>

							Senate Committees</p>
							<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">At the 
							core of Congress’ lawmaking, investigative and 
							oversight functions lies the committee system. This 
							is so because much of the business of Congress, it 
							has been well said, is done in the committee. 
							Specific problems, whether local or national in 
							scope, are initially brought to the forum of 
							congressional committees where they are subjected to 
							rigid and thorough discussions.</p>
							<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">
							Congressional hearings and investigations on matters 
							dealing with every field of legislative concern have 
							frequently been conducted by congressional 
							committees. </p>
							<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">To a 
							large extent, therefore, the committee system plays 
							a very significant role in the legislative process. 
							Congressional responses and actions vis-a-vis 
							growing national problems and concerns have 
							considerably relied upon the efficiency and 
							effectiveness of the committee structure, system and 
							expertise. As pointed out by Woodrow Wilson 
							regarding the important roles played by different 
							committees of Congress: </p>
							<blockquote>
								<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">The 
								House sits, not for serious discussion, but to 
								sanction the conclusions of the Committees as 
								rapidly as possible. It legislates in its 
								committee rooms; not by the deliberation of 
								majorities, but by the resolutions of 
								specially-commissioned minorities; so that it is 
								not far from the truth to say that Congress in 
								session is Congress on public exhibition, while 
								Congress in its committee rooms is Congress at 
								work.</p>
							</blockquote>
							<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">On the 
							other hand, the merits of Polsby’s view with regard 
							to the importance of the committee system can be 
							well considered: </p>
							<blockquote>
								<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">Any 
								proposal that weakens the capabilities of 
								congressional committees weakens Congress. 
								Congressional committees are the listening posts 
								of Congress. They accumulate knowledge about the 
								performance of governmental agencies and about 
								the effects of governmental programs and 
								performance on private citizens. They provide 
								incentives to members of Congress to involve 
								themselves in the detailed understanding of 
								governmental functioning. They provide a basis - 
								virtually the only well institutionalized basis 
								in the House of Representatives - for 
								understanding and for influencing public 
								policy.&nbsp;</p>
								</blockquote>
								<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">The 
								present committee system in the Senate has by 
								far been the product of strong years of 
								Philippine legislative experience. It draws its 
								strength from the inherent functions it is 
								mandated to perform, i.e., to assist the 
								Congress in coming up with well studied 
								legislative policy enactments. Yet the 
								complexity of problems that our country is 
								currently facing and the growing needs and 
								demands of our people for a more assertive role 
								on the part of Congress cannot but require us to 
								assess the effectiveness as well as the 
								responsiveness of the congressional committee 
								structure and system. In order to survive and 
								meet the challenges, Congress must adjust to 
								external demands and cope with internal 
								stresses. It must be pointed out that social, 
								economic, and political developments generate 
								demands that the legislature pass legislation or 
								take other action to meet constitutional and 
								public expectations concerning the general 
								welfare. The continuing rise of unemployment, 
								poverty, economic depression, scandals, crises 
								and calamities of various kinds, energy problem 
								and accelerating technological innovations, all 
								intensify pressures upon Congress. Political or 
								governmental shifts, aggressive presidential 
								leadership, partisan realignments, and momentous 
								and controversial Supreme Court rulings, among 
								other things, also drive the congressional 
								workload. </p>
							
							<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">
							However, the effects of external demands create 
							interpersonal stresses within Congress, and in the 
							Senate in particular. For instance, a ballooning 
							workload (external demand) of some committees has 
							caused personal or committee scrambles for 
							jurisdiction (internal stress). Other tensions that 
							may be considered range from the growth in the 
							member-ship of various committees, jurisdictional 
							disputes among several committees, shifts in its 
							personnel, factional disputes and members’ shifting 
							attitudes or norms. Such conflicts surface in 
							recurrent debates over pay, requisites, committee 
							jurisdictions, rules scheduling, and budgetary 
							procedures which necessitate the call for an 
							assessment of the present structure of the Senate 
							Committee System. <br />The present committee structure of the Senate is 
							composed of 36 standing committees and five ad hoc 
							and oversight committees. These standing committees 
							with their respective jurisdictions are as follows: </p>
							<blockquote>

			      		</p><hr /><p align="justify" class="h3_uline"><aname="The_Secretariat"></a>The Secretariat</p>
						<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">The process 
						of legislation, to begin with, has not been merely 
						confined to the enactment of laws or the passage of 
						legislative proposals or resolutions. Though the latter 
						is considered as its primary function, Congress has 
						likewise performed other equally important functions, 
						such as those flowing from its investigative and 
						oversight powers. </p>
						<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">
						Essentially, therefore, the process of legislation must 
						be viewed as a dynamic process. Although theoretically 
						associated with the operation of Congress, the 
						legislative process likewise involves an elaborate 
						network of external relations, linkages and coordination 
						with other institutions, agencies, organizations and 
						interest groups in society. </p>
						<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">It has been 
						said that the legislature is not an isolated 
						institution. As one of the traditional branches of the 
						government, Congress must continuously interact with 
						both the executive and the judiciary. To gain strength 
						and advantages, it must establish linkages with the 
						various sectors of society including the academe, media, 
						and other research-oriented groups. Likewise, to assert 
						a more relevant role, the legislature must always be 
						conscious of its role in checking the excesses of the 
						administration, in educating the public about the issues 
						of the day, as well as in overseeing the conduct, 
						behavior and performance of government agencies and 
						officials in the discharge of their official functions. </p>
						<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">It is 
						therefore in the context of the above roles and 
						functions of Congress that lawmakers find it extremely 
						necessary to rely upon their staff and support services 
						who will help them not only in the gathering of needed 
						basic information and relevant technical data, but also 
						in building feedback mechanism, linkages and ties with 
						the socio-economic and political environment. </p>
						<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">The 
						significant and essential role assumed by legislative 
						support services, moreover, can easily be seen through 
						their active participation in the different stages of 
						lawmaking. Laws are enacted precisely to respond to or 
						meet with a given societal problem - both actual and 
						perceived. Legislation is therefore prompted by the 
						necessity to address the needs and problems in society. 
						Thus, while legislators are charged with the task of 
						making laws, a great deal of ideas, data and tools 
						necessary in the initiation, formulation and preparation 
						of legislative proposals are gathered and collected 
						through the assistance and initiative of the legislative 
						staff and support services. </p>
						<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">Thus, the 
						nature and form of support service, as far as this is 
						concerned, must indispensably be responsive to the needs 
						of legislation. The services to be rendered cannot 
						always be routinary and constant but must be flexible in 
						order to adapt, from time to time, to the ever-changing 
						needs and requirements of the Senate. Of course, there 
						are specific services which ought to be religiously 
						complied with in accordance with the mandate of our 
						Constitution, such as the preparation of journals and 
						transcripts. But, to a large extent, support services 
						require a certain degree of procedural flexibility and 
						adaptability, especially in the technical substance and 
						content of legislation in the Philippine context. </p>
						<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px">The Senate 
						Secretariat performs all kinds of support services 
						needed by the senators. The nature and form of such 
						services range from legislative to administrative, 
						financial and security services required not only by the 
						senators themselves but also by their office staff and 
						employees. </p>						<p class="backtotop"><img src="/images/backtotop.gif" />
