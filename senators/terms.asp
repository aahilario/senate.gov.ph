											<a name="Term_of_Office_of_Senators"></a>Term of Office of Senators</p>
						<p align="justify">The term of the members of the Senate 
						is expressly provided in Articles VI and XVIII 
						respectively of the Constitution:</p>
						<blockquote>
							<p align="justify"><i>Sec. 4. The term of office of 
							the Senators shall be six years and shall commence, 
							unless otherwise provided by law, at noon on the 
							thirtieth day of June next following their election.</i></p>
							<p align="justify"><i>Sec. 2. The Senators, members 
							of the House of Representatives, and the local 
							officials first elected under this Constitution 
							shall serve until noon of June 30, 1992.</i></p>
							<p align="justify"><i>Of the Senators elected in the 
							election in 1992, the first twelve obtaining the 
							highest number of votes shall serve for six years 
							and the remaining twelve for three years.</i></p>
						</blockquote>
						<p align="justify">It must be remembered that the 24 
						Senators first elected under the 1987 Constitution on 
						May 2, 1987 served only for five years ending on June 
						30, 1992. Of the senators elected in 1992, the first 12 
						obtaining the highest number of votes served for the 
						full term of six years expiring in 1998, and the last 12 
						served only three years and ended in 1995. After which, 
						the 12 Senators elected in 1995 shall serve the full 
						term of six years or until year 2001. Those 12 to be 
						elected in 1998 shall also serve the full term of six 
						years. In fine, beginning 1992, 12 Senators shall be 
						elected every three years, so that unlike in the House 
						of Representatives, the Senate shall not at anytime be 
						completely dissolved. One-half of the membership is 
						retained as the other half is replaced or reelected 
						every three years.</p>
						<p align="justify">The purpose of the continuity of the 
						life of the Senate is intended to encourage the 
						maintenance of Senate policies as well as guarantee that 
						there will be experienced members who can help and train 
						newcomers in the discharge of their duties. In addition, 
						in case of resignation, death, permanent disability, 
						removal from office, or resignation of the President and 
						Vice-President, the Senate President shall act as 
						President.</p>
						<p align="justify">Moreover, the Constitution, in 
						Section 4, Article VI, provides limits to the extent a 
						member of the Senate can run for reelection. It provides 
						as follows:</p>
						<blockquote>
							<p align="justify"><i>No Senator shall serve for 
							more than two consecutive terms. Voluntary 
							renunciation of the office for any length of time 
							shall not be considered as an inter-ruption in the 
							continuity of his service for the full term for 
							which he was elected.</i></p>

							Salaries</p>
							<p align="justify">The salaries of members of the 
							Senate is governed by Article VI of the Constitution 
							as follows:</p>
							<blockquote>
								<p align="justify"><i>Sec. 10. The salaries of 
								Senators and Members of the House of 
								Representatives shall be determined by law. No 
								increase in said compensation shall take effect 
								until after the expiration of the full term of 
								all the members of the Senate and the House of 
								Representatives approving such increase.</i></p>
								<p align="justify"><i>Sec. 20. The records and 
								books of accounts of Congress shall be preserved 
								and be open to the public in accordance with 
								law, and such books shall be audited by the 
								Commission on Audit which shall publish annually 
								an itemized list of amounts paid to and expenses 
								incurred for each Member.</i></p>
							</blockquote>
							<p align="justify">It must be noted that in 
							accordance with the above provisions, there is no 
							prohibition against the receipt of allowances by the 
							members of Congress. The second section, on the 
							other hand, seeks to avoid the recurrence of the 
							abuses committed by the members of the Old Congress 
							in allotting themselves fabulous allowances the 
							amount of which they refused to divulge to the 
							people. It is now provided under the Constitution 
							that the books of accounts of Congress shall be open 
							to public inspection and must be audited by the 
							Commission on Audit. Moreover, every member of 
							Congress’ itemized expenditures, including 
							allowances, shall be published annually for the 
							information of the people.</p>
							<p align="justify">It is interesting to note that 
							the Constitution in Section 17, Article XVIII, 
							provides the corresponding salaries of Senators, to 
							wit:</p>
							<blockquote>
								<p align="justify"><i>Until the Congress 
								provides otherwise, the President shall receive 
								an annual salary of three hundred thousand 
								pesos; the Vice-President, the President of the 
								Senate, the Speaker of the House of 
								Representatives, and the Chief Justice of the 
								Supreme Court, two hundred forty thousand pesos 
								each; the Senators, the members of the House of 
								Representatives, the Associate Justices of the 
								Supreme Court, and the Chairmen of the 
								Constitutional Commissions, two hundred four 
								thousand pesos each; and the Members of the 
								Constitutional Commissions, one hundred eighty 
								thousand pesos each.</i></p>
							</blockquote>
							<p align="justify">However, under Joint Resolution 
							No. 1, the salaries of the members of the Senate is 
							increased to salary grade 33 with monthly equivalent 
							rate of P35,000.00. The Senate President, on the 
							other hand, is raised to salary grade 34 with a 
							monthly basic salary of P40,000.00.</p>

								Privilege from Arrest</p>
								<p align="justify" dir="ltr">One of the 
								privileges that a member of Congress enjoys is 
								the privilege from arrest. In this regard, 
								Section 11, Article VI, of the Constitution 
								provides as follows:</p>
								<blockquote>
									<p align="justify" dir="ltr"><i>A Senator or 
									Member of the House of Representatives 
									shall, in all offenses punishable by not 
									more than six years imprisonment, be 
									privileged from arrest while the Congress is 
									in session. No member shall be questioned 
									nor be held liable in any other place for 
									any speech or debate in Congress or in any 
									committee thereof.</i></p>
								</blockquote>
								<p align="justify" dir="ltr">This privilege is 
								intended to insure representation of the 
								constituents by the members of Congress. In Vera 
								vs. Avelino, the Supreme Court, quoting a 
								decision of the United States Supreme Court, 
								explained for whose benefit the right to 
								parliamentary immunity is secured:</p>
								<blockquote>
									<p align="justify" dir="ltr"><i>These 
									privileges are thus secured not with the 
									intention of protecting the members against 
									prosecutors for their own benefit, but to 
									support the rights of the people, by 
									enabling their representatives to execute 
									the function of their office without fear of 
									prosecution, civil or criminal.</i></p>
								</blockquote>
								<p align="justify" dir="ltr">A member of 
								Congress could only be suspended by the House of 
								which he is a member and only for the purpose of 
								self-preservation or self-protection. To protect 
								a member of Congress from oppression, even this 
								power has been circumscribed by the 1935 
								Constitution and further limited by the 1987 
								Constitution.</p>
								<p align="justify" dir="ltr">The rationale for 
								this was expressed by the Supreme Court as early 
								as 11 September 1924 in Alejandrino vs. Quezon:</p>
								<blockquote>
									<p align="justify" dir="ltr"><i>It is 
									noteworthy that the Congress of the United 
									States shall not in all its long history 
									suspend a member. And the reason is obvious. 
									Punishment by way of reprimand or fine 
									vindicates the outraged dignity of the House 
									without depriving the constituency of 
									representation; expulsion, when permissible, 
									likewise vindicates the honor of the 
									legislative body while giving to the 
									constituency an opportunity to elect anew; 
									but suspension deprives the electoral 
									district of representation without that 
									district being afforded any means by which 
									to fill the vacancy. By suspension, the seat 
									remains filled, but the occupant is 
									silenced.</i></p>

										<p align="justify" dir="ltr">Privilege

										enjoyed by a Member of Congress provided 
										for in Section 11, Article VI of the 
										Constitution. It states as follows:</p>
										<p align="justify" dir="ltr"><i>Sec. 11. 
										A Senator or Member of the House of 
										Representatives shall, in all offenses 
										be punishable by not more than six years 
										imprisonment, be privileged from arrest

										follows:</p>
										<blockquote>
											<p align="justify" dir="ltr"><i>Sec. 
											110. After the consideration of the

										be extended for such time as may be 
										necessary for him to finish his speech 
										unless a majority of all the Senators 
										vote against such extension.</p>

									2. Purpose of the Privilege</p>
									<p align="justify" dir="ltr">Members of 
									Congress cannot be prosecuted for any words 
									spoken in debate or in connection with 
									voting or used in written reports or with 
									things generally done in a session of either 
									House in relation to the business before it. 
									This protection is extended to them during 
									the session on the occasion of the exercise 
									of their functions either in their 
									respective chambers or in joint assembly, or 
									in committees or commission. The purpose of 
									this privilege of speech or debate is not to 
									protect the members against prosecutions for 
									their own benefit but to enable them as 
									representatives of the people to execute the 
									functions of their office without fear of 
									prosecution, civil or criminal. As held in 
									the case of Osmeña v. Pendatun, the Supreme 
									Court took the occasion of defining the 
									purpose of the privilege. It ruled:</p>
									<blockquote>
										<p align="justify" dir="ltr"><i>Our 
										Constitution enshrines parliamentary 
										immunity which is a fundamental 
										privilege cherished in every legislative 
										assembly of the democratic world. As old 
										as the English Parliament, its purpose 
										is to enable and encourage a 
										representative of the public to 
										discharge his public trust with firmness 
										and success for it is indispensably 
										necessary that he should enjoy the 
										fullest liberty of speech, and that he 
										should be protected from the resentment 
										of every one, however, powerful, to whom 
										the exercise of that liberty may 
										occasion. Such immunity has come to this 
										country from the practices of Parliament 
										as construed and applied by the Congress 
										of the United States. Its extent and 
										application remain no longer in doubt 
										insofar as related to the question 
										before us. It guarantees the legislator 
										complete freedom of expression without 
										fear of being made responsible in 
										criminal or civil actions before the 
										courts or any other forum outside of the 
										Congressional hall. But it does not 
										protect him from responsibility before 
										the legislative body itself whenever his 
										words and conduct are considered by the 
										latter disorderly or unbecoming to a 
										member thereof.</i></p>

									3. Precedents and Practices</p>
									<p align="justify" dir="ltr">The following 
									are some of the precedents and practices 
									observed in the previous sessions of 
									Congress concerning the privilege speech:</p>
									<blockquote>
										<p align="justify" dir="ltr"><b>3.1. 
										When It Can and When It Cannot</b></p>
										<p align="justify" dir="ltr">It has been 
										ruled that the privilege granted under 
										this section cannot be availed of when 
										the House has already proceeded to 
										transact its business, such as the 
										consideration of bills. But in a certain 
										case, when the House was already 
										considering unfinished business or 
										business for the day, a member was 
										permitted, through a motion unanimously 
										approved, to deliver a short speech on 
										an important case in his province. A 
										member availing himself of such a 
										privilege was entitled to one full hour. 
										Having the floor on the privilege hour, 
										he could not be forced to yield to 
										interpellations.</p>
										<p align="justify" dir="ltr">The 
										one-hour privilege not having expired 
										yet, a member, who requested only 10 
										minutes in order to deliver his speech, 
										was allowed to use the rest of the hour. 
										He could not be precluded from 
										continuing with his speech until the one 
										hour was consumed.</p>
										<p align="justify" dir="ltr"><b>3.2. On 
										Request for Reservation</b></p>
										<p align="justify" dir="ltr">On point of 
										order whether preference be given to a 
										member who requests a previous 
										reservation over any member who stands 
										up on the floor ahead of the former, it 
										has been held that an unwritten rule, 
										sanctioned by immemorial practice, 
										establishes such a preference. A request 
										for reservation to use the privilege 
										hour on a future date made on the floor 
										by a member is recorded in the Journal.</p>
										<p align="justify" dir="ltr">The time of 
										a member automatically expires the 
										moment he takes his seat and, 
										consequently, he cannot answer questions 
										unless an extension of his time is 
										granted by unanimous consent. The 
										one-hour privilege can be extended only 
										by unanimous consent.</p>
										<p align="justify" dir="ltr"><b>3.3. 
										Decorum on Speech</b></p>
										<p align="justify" dir="ltr">A member, 
										availing himself of the privilege hour,

										language in conformity with the decorum 
										and dignity of the House.</p>
										<p align="justify" dir="ltr">The Chair 
										entertained a motion to delete from the 
										Record a portion of a member’s speech 
										under the privilege hour as 
										unparliamentary for being against the 
										dignity and integrity of the members, 
										and when submitted by the Chair to the 
										House, the motion was approved.</p>
										<p align="justify" dir="ltr">When a

										and deprived further use of the

										<p align="justify" dir="ltr">A member 
										should, during the privilege hour, 
										refrain from making personal allusions 
										to any member. In availing himself of 
										the privilege hour, a member may, under 
										his own responsibility, speak against an 
										absent fellow member. It is indecorous 
										of the Senate during a privilege speech.</p>
										<p align="justify" dir="ltr">In the 
										exercise of his one- hour privilege, a 
										member can speak on any subject of 
										national interest, and he may even 
										criticize the President on the 
										appointment of certain persons to the 
										government. But delivering speeches 
										attacking the Chief Executive 
										constitutes disorderly conduct for which 
										a member may be suspended or expelled 
										from the House as a disciplinary action. 
										The Chair sustained a point of order 
										which asked for deletion from the 
										Record, as unparliamentary, parts of the 
										privilege speech attacking the Catholic

										<p align="justify" dir="ltr"><b>3.4. 
										Interpellation</b></p>
										<p align="justify" dir="ltr">A member 
										having the floor to avail himself of the

										interpellation or yield for information. 
										He cannot be forced to yield to another 
										so that, in turn, the latter can answer 
										questions.</p>
										<p align="justify" dir="ltr">It is in 
										order for a member interpellating to lay 
										the premises of his question. He may 
										interpellate in the manner he so desires 
										and use any of the official languages 
										even if different from that used by the 
										member who has the floor.</p>
										<p align="justify" dir="ltr">A member on 
										the floor using the remaining portion of 
										the privilege hour may stop yielding to 
										further interpellations.</p>
										<p align="justify" dir="ltr">The time 
										consumed by interpellation is counted 
										against a member who has the floor; that 
										is the reason why he has the option to 
										yield or not to questions.</p>
										<p align="justify" dir="ltr"><b>3.5. 
										Precedence and Interruption</b></p>
										<p align="justify" dir="ltr">The House 
										sustained the Chair that after the 
										reading of the order of business, the 
										one-hour privilege has precedence over 
										any other matters, such as question of 
										privilege.</p>
										<p align="justify" dir="ltr">A member 
										availing himself of the one-hour 
										privilege may yield to further 
										interpellation, but he cannot be 
										interrupted except by a point of order. 
										He cannot be deprived of the floor 
										except with his consent, and he may 
										deliver his speech in such manner as he 
										pleases as long as he speaks with due 
										decorum. The Chair did not entertain a 
										motion referring a one-hour privilege 
										speech to a committee on the ground that 
										while a member is enjoying the 
										privilege, he cannot be deprived of the 
										floor except by a point of order.</p>
										<p align="justify" dir="ltr"><b>3.6. 
										Extension of Time</b></p>
										<p align="justify" dir="ltr">After a 
										member has consumed the privilege hour, 
										no extension of time for the privilege 
										can be granted if there is an objection 
										to the motion for such extension.</p>
										<p align="justify" dir="ltr">An 
										objection to a motion for extension of 
										the one-hour privilege is not debatable.</p>
										<p align="justify" dir="ltr">The 
										one-hour privilege can no longer be 
										extended when, after its delivery, the 
										member using the privilege sits down, 
										thereby forfeiting his right to 
										continue. When a member sits down after 
										the expiration of his one-hour 
										privilege, his time can no longer be 
										extended.</p>
										<p align="justify" dir="ltr">A member 
										who has the privilege hour may yield a 
										portion of it to another member. When a 
										member ceded a portion of his one-hour 
										privilege, such a portion could not, 
										without his consent, be extended to more 
										than the number of minutes agreed upon.<br />A member using the remaining portion of 
										the privilege hour may refuse any 
										interpellation in order to save the time 
										left for him.</p>
										<p align="justify" dir="ltr"><b>3.7.

								Manner of Imposing Discipline</p>
								<p align="justify" dir="ltr">Section 16(3), 
								Article VI of the Constitution provides the 
								manner in which members of the Senate may be 
								disciplined, suspended or expelled. It provides 
								as follows:</p>
								<blockquote>
									<p align="justify" dir="ltr"><i>Each House 
									may determine the rules of its proceedings, 
									punish its Members for disorderly behavior, 
									and with the concurrence of two-thirds of 
									all its Members, suspend or expel a Member. 
									A penalty of suspension, when imposed, shall 
									not exceed sixty days.</i></p>
								</blockquote>
								<p align="justify" dir="ltr">Rules of 
								proceedings are needed for the orderly conduct 
								of the sessions of Congress. Unless such rules 
								violate fundamental or individual rights, they 
								are within the exclusive discretion of each 
								House to formulate and interpret and may not be 
								judicially reversed.</p>
								<p align="justify" dir="ltr">Without the above 
								provision, the authority to discipline its 
								members can still be exercised by each House as 
								an inherent power, with the concurrence of a 
								majority vote, conformably to the general rule 
								on the will of the majority. With this 
								provision, the disciplinary power is not so much 
								expressly conferred as limited because of the 
								specific conditions laid down for its proper 
								exercise.</p>
								<p align="justify" dir="ltr">Thus, the courts 
								may annul any expulsion or suspension of a 
								member that is not concurred in by at least 
								two-thirds of the entire body or any suspension 
								meted out by the legislature, even with the 
								required two-thirds vote, as to any period in 
								excess of the 60-day maximum duration. These are 
								procedural matters and therefore justiciable.</p>
								<p align="justify" dir="ltr">But the 
								interpretation of the phrase &quot;disorderly 
								behavior&quot; is the prerogative of Congress and 
								cannot as a rule be judicially reviewed. The 
								matter comes in the category of a political 
								question. Accordingly, the Supreme Court did not 
								interfere when the legislature declared that the 
								physical assault by one member against another, 
								or the delivery of a derogatory speech which the 
								member was unable to substantiate, constituted 
								&quot;disorderly behavior&quot; and justified the adoption 
								of disciplinary measures.</p>
								<p align="justify" dir="ltr">Other disciplinary 
								measures besides expulsion and suspension are 
								deletion of unparliamentary remarks from the 
								record, fine, imprisonment and censure, 
								sometimes called &quot;soft impeachment.&quot;</p>

									pecuniary benefit or where he may be called 
									upon to act on account of his office.</i></p>
								</blockquote>
								<p align="justify" dir="ltr">Appearance of the 
								legislator is now barred before all courts of 
								justice, regardless of rank, composition, or 
								jurisdiction. The disqualification also applies 
								to the revived Electoral Tribunal and to all 
								administrative bodies, like the Securities and 
								Exchange Commission and the National Labor 
								Relations Commission. Courts martial and 
								military tribunals, being administrative 
								agencies, are included.</p>
								<p align="justify" dir="ltr">The purpose of the 
								disqualifications is to prevent the legislator 
								from exerting undue influence, deliberately or 
								not, upon the body where he is appearing. The 
								pressure may not be intended; normally, the 
								appearance is enough, considering the powers 
								available to the legislator which he can 
								exercise to reward or punish a judge deciding 
								his case or, in the case of the Electoral 
								Tribunal, his close association with its 
								members. This is the reason the prohibited 
								appearance must be personal. The 
								lawyer-legislator may still engage in the 
								practice of his profession except that when it 
								comes to trials and hearings before the bodies 
								above-mentioned, appearance may be made not by 
								him but by other members of his law office.</p>
								<p align="justify" dir="ltr">In Puyat v. De 
								Guzman, a legislator entered his appearance as 
								counsel for one of the parties to an 
								intracorporate dispute before the Securities and 
								Exchange Commission. He desisted when his 
								representation was challenged under the 
								above-mentioned section. Thereafter, he 
								purchased P200 worth of stocks in the 
								corporation from the faction he was representing 
								and sought to intervene in the said dispute, 
								this time as a stockholder. The Supreme Court 
								did not allow him to do so as his evident 
								purpose was to circumvent the constitutional 
								prohibition. Justice Melencio Herrera declared:</p>
								<blockquote>
									<p align="justify" dir="ltr"><i>Under those 
									facts and circumstances, we are constrained 
									to hold that there has been an indirect 
									appearance as counsel before xxx an 
									administrative body’ and in our opinion, 
									that is circumvention of the constitutional 
									prohibition. The intervention was an 
									afterthought to enable him to appear 
									actively in the proceeding in some other 
									capacity. To believe the avowed purpose, 
									that is, to enable him eventually to vote 
									and to be elected as Director in the event 
									of an unfavorable outcome of the SEC case, 
									would be pure naivete. He would still appear 
									as counsel indirectly.</i></p>
								</blockquote>
								<p align="justify" dir="ltr">Legislators are 
								prohibited from being financially interested in 
								any contract with the government or any 
								subdivision, agency or instrumentality thereof, 
								including government-owned or controlled 
								corporations, or in any franchise or special 
								privilege granted by any of these during their 
								term of office, because of the influences they 
								can easily exercise in obtaining these 
								concessions. The idea is to prevent abuses from 
								being committed by the members of Congress to 
								the prejudice of the public welfare and 
								particularly of legitimate contractors with the 
								government who otherwise might be placed at a 
								disadvantageous position vis-à-vis the 
								legislator.</p>
								<p align="justify" dir="ltr">It should be noted, 
								though, that not every transaction with the 
								government is barred by this provision. The 
								contracts referred to here are those involving 
								&quot;financial interest,&quot; that is, contracts from 
								which the legislator expects to derive some 
								profit at the expense of the government. An 
								illustration is a contract for public works or 
								the sale of office equipment or supplies to the 
								government. By contrast, it cannot be said that 
								the legislator will profit financially from a 
								contract of carriage with a government 
								instrumentality like the PAL since it is the 
								carrier that will benefit from the passenger’s 
								fare.</p>
								<p align="justify" dir="ltr">The last sentence 
								restores an inhibition originally imposed by the 
								1935 Constitution. Although this provision has 
								never been judicially interpreted, it may be 
								surmised that the rule shall apply to the case,

								<blockquote>
									<p align="justify" dir="ltr"><i>Sec. 13. No

									created or the emoluments thereof increased 
									during the term for which he was elected.</i></p>
								</blockquote>
								<p align="justify" dir="ltr">The first part of 
								this section refers to what are known as 
								incompatible offices, which may not be held by 
								the legislator during his tenure in Congress. 
								The purpose is to prevent him from owing loyalty 
								to another branch of the government, to the 
								detriment of the independence of the legislature 
								and the doctrine of separation of powers.</p>
								<p align="justify" dir="ltr">The prohibition 
								against the holding of an incompatible office is 
								not absolute; what is not allowed is the 
								simultaneous holding of that office and the seat 
								in Congress. In the case of the rest of the 
								legislators, any of them may hold another office 
								or employment in the government provided he 
								forfeits, as a result, his position in Congress.</p>
								<p align="justify" dir="ltr">Forfeiture of the 
								legislator’s seat, or cessation of his tenure, 
								shall be automatic upon the holding of the 
								incompatible office. Thus, a congress-man who 
								was elected provincial governor was deemed to 
								have automatically forfeited his seat in the 
								House of Representatives when he took his oath 
								for the provincial office. No resolution was 
								necessary to declare his legislative post 
								vacant.</p>
								<p align="justify" dir="ltr">In Adaza v. Pacana, 
								the petitioner and the respondent were elected 
								governor and vice-governor, respectively, of 
								Misamis Oriental. Both subsequently ran for the 
								Batasang Pambansa, but only the petitioner won. 
								Adaza then qualified as a member of the 
								lawmaking body, whereupon Pacana assumed the 
								governorship as statutory successor. Adaza 
								challenged Pacana’s takeover, contending that 
								under the parliamentary system a legislator 
								could concurrently serve as governor; hence, 
								there was no vacancy in the governorship that 
								Pacana could fill. Through Justice Escolin, the 
								Court unanimously rejected this argument and 
								held that Adaza automatically forfeited the 
								governorship the moment he took his oath as a 
								member of the Batasang Pambansa.</p>
								<p align="justify" dir="ltr">The constitutional 
								prohibition against a member of the Batasang 
								Pambansa from holding any other office or 
								employment in the government during his tenure 
								is clear. Section 10, Article VIII of the 1973 
								Constitution provides as follows:</p>
								<blockquote>
									<p align="justify" dir="ltr"><i>Sec. 10. A 
									Member of the National Assembly shall not 
									hold any other office or employment in the 
									government or any subdivision, agency or 
									instrumentality thereof, including 
									government-owned or controlled corporations, 
									during his tenure, except that of prime 
									minister or member of the cabinet. xxx</i></p>
								</blockquote>
								<p align="justify" dir="ltr">The language used 
								in the above-cited section is plain. The only 
								exceptions mentioned therein are the offices of 
								prime minister and cabinet member. The wisdom or 
								expediency of the said provision is a matter 
								which is not within the province of the Court to 
								determine.</p>
								<p align="justify" dir="ltr">A public office is 
								a public trust. It is created for the interest 
								and the benefit of the people. As such, a holder 
								thereof is subject to such regulations and 
								conditions as the law may impose and he cannot 
								complain of any restrictions which public policy 
								may dictate on his holding of more than one 
								office. It is therefore of no avail to 
								petitioner that the system of government in 
								other states allows a local elective official to 
								act as an elected member of the parliament at 
								the same time. The dictate of the people in whom 
								legal sovereignty lies is explicit. It provides 
								no exceptions save the two offices specifically 
								cited in the above-quoted constitutional 
								provision. Thus, while it may be said that 
								within the purely parliamentary system of 
								government no incompatibility exists in the 
								nature of the two offices under consideration, 
								as incompatibility herein present is one created 
								by no less than the Constitution itself. In the 
								case at bar, there is no question that 
								petitioner has taken his oath of office as an 
								elected Mambabatas Pambansa and has been 
								discharging his duties as such. In the light of 
								the oft-mentioned constitutional provision, this 
								fact operated to vacate his former post and he 
								cannot now continue to occupy the same, nor 
								attempt to discharge its functions.</p>
								<p align="justify" dir="ltr">But not every other 
								office or employment is to be regarded as 
								incompatible with the legislative position. For 
								example, membership in the Electoral Tribunal is 
								permitted by the Constitution itself. Moreover, 
								if it can be shown that the second office is an 
								extension of the legislative position or is in 
								aid of legislative duties, the holding thereof 
								will not result in the loss of the legislator’s 
								seat in Congress.</p>
								<p align="justify" dir="ltr">Accordingly, the 
								chairmen of the Senate and House committees on 
								education retain their seats in Congress while 
								sitting concurrently as ex-officio members in 
								the U.P. Board of Regents. Legislators who serve 
								as treaty negotiators under the President of the 
								Philippines continue to sit in Congress, where 
								they can better work for the approval of the 
								treaty and the passage of the needed 
								implementing legislation.</p>
								<p align="justify" dir="ltr">But even if a 
								member of Congress is willing to forfeit his 
								seat therein, he may not be appointed to any 
								civil office in the government that has been 
								created or the emoluments thereof have been 
								increased while he was incumbent in the 
								legislature. Such a position is a forbidden 
								office.</p>
								<p align="justify" dir="ltr">The purpose is to 
								prevent trafficking in public office. Were the 
								rule otherwise, certain legislators, especially 
								those not sure of reelection, might be able to 
								work for the creation or improvement of 
								lucrative positions and, in combination with the 
								President, arrange for their appointment thereto

								<p align="justify" dir="ltr">Notably, this 
								provision does not apply to elective offices, 
								which are filled by the voters themselves.</p>
								<p align="justify" dir="ltr">The appointment of 
								a member of Congress to the forbidden office is 
								not allowed only during the term for which he 
								was elected, when such office was created or its 
								emoluments were increased. After such term, and 
								even if the legislator is reelected, the 
								disqualification no longer applies and he may 
								therefore be appointed to the office. </p>
